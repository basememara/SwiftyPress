This is so true;\u00a0less code and less memory while performing the same task at hand is truly where the art comes in. So in this sobering post, I&#8217;d like to highlight some\u00a0of the various pitfalls that lead to memory leaks, which inevitably result in crashes. I will also cover some tools and remedies to resolve these issues.<\/p>\n<h2>Back to the Basics:\u00a0Reference Counting<\/h2>\n<p>On\u00a0the machine-level, memory is allocated for our\u00a0software\u00a0during runtime. Anytime an object, variable, or data\u00a0is created, it&#8217;s stored in memory by the system. How does the software we write access that memory? This is where references, pointers, and handles come in, which are\u00a0basically associations to the memory location. It&#8217;s the glue between our software and the machine; where the virtual and physical world meet.<\/p>\n<p>For example, say I create an instance and pass it around to other variables:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6781863353126\/]<br \/>\nThe instance of &#8220;<em>Car(plate: &#8220;ABC123&#8221;)<\/em>&#8221; is not actually stored in &#8220;car1&#8221;. This actually doesn&#8217;t make sense when you think about it. The variable &#8220;<em>car1<\/em>&#8221; isn&#8217;t memory, its text in your source code that represents a location to memory. This is what a reference is, &#8220;<em>car1<\/em>&#8221; is actually referencing the memory location of the\u00a0&#8220;<em>Car(plate: &#8220;ABC123&#8221;)<\/em>&#8221; instance.<\/p>\n<p>Even though there are 3 variables, &#8220;<em>car1<\/em>&#8220;, &#8220;<em>car2<\/em>&#8220;, and &#8220;<em>car3<\/em>&#8220;, there is only one instance, &#8220;<em>Car(plate: &#8220;ABC123&#8221;)<\/em>&#8220;.\u00a0The 3 variables are referencing that same memory location of the instance. This means the reference count is 3 for that object, <em>therefore reference counting is occurring<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>If you <em>nil<\/em> one variable out:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee678b176998988\/]<br \/>\nNow the reference count is down to 2. Now if you do it again:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee678e753530517\/]<br \/>\nThe reference count\u00a0is down to 1. And one more time:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6791781300266\/]<br \/>\nFinally, the reference count is zero and now the system deallocates\u00a0the instance from memory and frees up that resource space.<\/p>\n<p>This is garbage collection and the algorithm Apple has chosen for its <em>Cocoa<\/em>, <em>Cocoa Touch<\/em>, and <em>Core Foundation<\/em> ecosystems. It seems archaic compared to tracing\u00a0garbage collections algorithms, such as those used in .NET and Java. However, it is the\u00a0most efficient since memory is freed right\u00a0away and doesn&#8217;t suffer from the performance intensities of sweeping unused memory. These advantages are\u00a0at the cost of burdening\u00a0programmers with\u00a0understanding memory allocation and avoiding\u00a0reference cycles.<\/p>\n<h2>How Memory Leaks Happen<\/h2>\n<p>The reference count increment\/decrement dance I&#8217;ve illustrated used to be a manual process back in the day with\u00a0Objective-C before iOS5. It was painful; <em>retain<\/em>, <em>release<\/em>, and <em>autorelease<\/em>\u00a0had to be manually written out by the programmer\u00a0to allocate and deallocate memory. If you ever forgot or missed deallocating memory for an instance, a memory leak would easily happen.<\/p>\n<p>Then Apple graced us with Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), which took the load off developers having to manually do the reference counting.\u00a0Reference counting didn&#8217;t go away though;\u00a0it\u00a0was just abstracted away by simply doing what\u00a0the developer would do to manage memory. The concept of reference counting lives on and there is another memory leak trap that has to do with reference counting: <em>strong reference cycles<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Strong Reference Cycles<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s add a driver to our previous example:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6794027353825\/]<br \/>\nThe &#8220;<em>Car<\/em>&#8221; class now has a &#8220;d<em>river<\/em>&#8221; property. Also, the &#8220;<em>Driver<\/em>&#8221; class has a property that is an array of &#8220;<em>cars<\/em>&#8220;. This is legitimate since a car can only have one driver, but a driver can have multiple cars.<\/p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s start assigning instances:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6797555831910\/]<br \/>\nThe reference count for the\u00a0driver and car instances in memory is\u00a02 each. Remember, only one instance is actually stored in memory; the variables and properties only hold a reference to their memory locations.<\/p>\n<p>Now\u00a0wipe out\u00a0<em>myCar<\/em> and <em>myDriver<\/em> variables\u00a0and let&#8217;s see what happens to the memory\u00a0deallocation:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67a8459158624\/]<br \/>\nYou just chopped off access to the instances in memory: &#8220;<em>Car(plate: &#8220;ABC123&#8221;)<\/em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>Driver(name: &#8220;Neo&#8221;)<\/em>&#8220;. Remember, even though those variables have been terminated, the actual instances still exist in memory. Why did the system not deallocate the instances? Because\u00a0they have properties in them that reference each other: <em>&lt;&lt;Car instance&gt;&gt;.driver<\/em> and <em>&lt;&lt;Driver instance&gt;&gt;.cars[0]<\/em>, so their reference count is not zero.\u00a0They are keeping each other alive and we have no way to get to them:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/reference-count.png\" alt=\"reference-count\" width=\"397\" height=\"267\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-774\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This is a\u00a0strong reference cycle; those instances will never be released from memory and are\u00a0inaccessible too.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Resolving Strong Reference Cycles Like It&#8217;s 1999!<\/h3>\n<p>On a basic level, the strong reference cycle can be prevented by cleaning up all the instances in the correct order the old fashioned way.\u00a0For example, before wiping out the driver variable,\u00a0clear out the &#8220;<em>driver<\/em>&#8221; property of the car instance first:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67ab487600730\/]<br \/>\nProblem solved! No more reference cycle and the instances are released from memory since no reference cycle exists that would keep each other alive. Likewise, you can pop off all the cars from the driver instance instead before wiping out the car variable:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67b2984677541\/]<br \/>\nProblem solved again! Just a different way.<\/p>\n<p>However, this is not a very elegant or scalable solution. This is just a small scenario. What happens if there are dozens of properties? And those properties are managed by other modules? How would I know when and if it&#8217;s ok to wipe out the properties and in what order?<\/p>\n<h3>2. Resolving Strong Reference Cycles\u00a0Like a\u00a0Champ!<\/h3>\n<p>Swift offers two keywords that break the strong reference cycle: &#8220;<em>weak<\/em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>unowned<\/em>&#8220;. These are decorators on the properties that tell the compiler not to increment the counter for those references. Below is how we would break the strong reference cycle:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67b5147272261\/]<br \/>\nNotice the &#8220;<em>driver<\/em>&#8221; property of the &#8220;<em>Car<\/em>&#8221; class is decorated with &#8220;<em>weak<\/em>&#8220;. It\u00a0means when this property creates a reference to an instance, do not increment\u00a0the instance&#8217;s reference count. This same concept gets applied to delegates, where it should almost always be declared as &#8220;<em>weak<\/em>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>What about &#8220;<em>unowned<\/em>&#8220;? It does the same thing, except this keyword is used for non-optional properties. It\u00a0implies that the property will never become <em>nil<\/em>. A common place this is used is with closures, where strong reference cycles lurk as well. For example,\u00a0let&#8217;s add a closure\u00a0property to the &#8220;<em>Driver<\/em>&#8221; class that outputs all the car plates they own:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67b8503321988\/]<br \/>\nThe property called &#8220;<em>allPlates<\/em>&#8221; doesn&#8217;t own &#8220;<em>self<\/em>&#8220;. It is not possible that the property would exist without the instance, so this makes a good candidate for &#8220;<em>[unowned]<\/em>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note 1:<\/em>\u00a0I could\u00a0have made &#8220;<em>allPlates<\/em>&#8221; a function, but there are scenarios that making a closure property makes sense if subclassing is overkill; instead of subclassing, overwriting the closure property with another closure is possible.<\/p>\n<p><em>Note 2:<\/em> Do not confuse a closure property with a lazy variable:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67bc522692762\/]<br \/>\nA strong reference cycle is not possible in this case since it is only executed once and deallocates right\u00a0after. In addition, if you were to add cars to the driver after this executed, calling this property would not consider\u00a0new cars so this is not what we want!<\/p>\n<p>Another common area where<em> [unowned self]<\/em> is used is <em>NSNotificationCenter<\/em> blocks:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67be342251817\/]<br \/>\nHowever, you do not have a possible strong reference cycle in &#8220;<em>UIView.animation<\/em>&#8221; because there&#8217;s no circular reference:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67c1132288680\/]<br \/>\nYou should be wondering why do you have to handle strong reference cycles in <em>NSNotificationCenter<\/em> and not\u00a0<em>UIView.animateWithDuration<\/em>. There are some quirks in the Cocoa framework itself that leak\u00a0objects. A couple of examples are\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/sealedabstract.com\/code\/nsnotificationcenter-with-blocks-considered-harmful\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NSNotificationCenter<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/26383031\/wkwebview-causes-my-view-controller-to-leak\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WKWebKit<\/a>. There&#8217;s not much you can do about this except to keep your ears to the ground and listen\u00a0to the community, as well as\u00a0poking\u00a0around popular open source libraries that\u00a0have\u00a0been battle tested.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, careful not to unnecessarily use <em>[weak\/unowned self]<\/em>, otherwise your objects will be deallocated right away before you get a chance to use it!<\/p>\n<h3>3. Resolving Strong Reference Cycles\u00a0Like\u00a0a Jedi!<\/h3>\n<p>There is one more way to handle strong reference cycle that is a complete mind shift: <em>use structs over classes!<\/em>\u00a0Value types keep a unique copy of their data, while reference types share a single copy of their data. This is in-line with Swift&#8217;s philosophy of value over reference types.\u00a0Almost everything in the Swift core library is immutable, about 100-to-1 in the source code! Structs are everywhere and rarely will you see a class in Swift. In fact, the Swift team is undertaking a major update\u00a0to the Foundation library, where it will wrap many <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/apple\/swift-evolution\/blob\/master\/proposals\/0069-swift-mutability-for-foundation.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reference types to value types<\/a>. \u00a0Choose a struct over a class any day or you better have a good reason!<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s update our &#8220;<em>Car<\/em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>Driver<\/em>&#8221; classes to structs:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67c4240840264\/]<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s it!\u00a0Good-bye strong reference cycles, <em>weak<\/em>, and <em>unowned<\/em>! This is because reference counts are\u00a0always 1 for value types. There are no references to it. Instead, they are copied when assigned to a new variable:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67c8760125518\/]<br \/>\nUsing value types over reference type is a world of difference with Objective-C and the recommended approach from the Swift team. It&#8217;s safer because many bugs in software arise from unexpected state changes. Of course, there is a place for classes, but as <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/videos\/play\/wwdc2015\/408\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crusty says<\/a>: Start with a protocol, then a struct, then a class when\u00a0necessary.<\/p>\n<p>The implications of this are vast, see be aware:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67ca911030487\/]<br \/>\nNotice with classes, updating &#8220;<em>car3<\/em>&#8221; affects &#8220;<em>car2<\/em>&#8220;. However with structs, updating &#8220;<em>car3<\/em>&#8221; is self contained and only affects &#8220;<em>car3<\/em>&#8220;. It&#8217;s very functional; inputting a value into function outputs another value without affecting the rest of the application &#8211; very modular! So before using value semantics, ensure you&#8217;re thinking value semantics and let it work for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Other Memory Issues<\/h2>\n<p>We only discussed memory leaks in this post, which is inaccessible memory that has\u00a0no more pointers to it. There are other memory issues that can plague your app that you should be conscious of.<\/p>\n<h3>Abandoned Memory<\/h3>\n<p>This kind of memory still has references to it, but\u00a0are wasted\u00a0since they\u00a0won&#8217;t ever be\u00a0used again.\u00a0There is\u00a0no good reason to access\u00a0that memory so it&#8217;s wasted resources. An example of this is pushing the same view controller over and over again without ever popping\/dismissing\u00a0it. Now you have duplicate\u00a0view controller instance on the view hierarchy. Not only is this wasted resources, but how do you know which one has the latest changes? Fortunately, this is a rookie mistake and easy to spot.<\/p>\n<h3>Cached Memory<\/h3>\n<p>Cache is great thing; whether it be images from the web or data from a database, it saves round trips to the server. However, without proper caching mechanisms in place, they can grow large and drown the resources fast. These are also easy to spot using trivial memory profilers. Implementing caching rules for the specific needs of the apps resolve these issues fast as well. There are some basic rules that can be enforced using the native <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Reference\/NSCache_Class\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NSCache<\/a>, or libraries that offer more sophisticated options, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Haneke\/HanekeSwift\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HanekeSwift<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Clean &amp; Dirty Memory<\/h2>\n<p>There are some hooks and triggers iOS provides that help guide you to manage memory. First we must understand there is the concept of clean and dirty memory.<\/p>\n<p>Clean memory is static resources that are loaded into memory that doesn&#8217;t change. They can be recreated at any time, such as system frameworks, binaries, mapped files, etc. The system gets rid of these first when under memory pressure, since it can always recreate\u00a0it when needed.<\/p>\n<p>Dirty memory is those that are\u00a0changed during runtime. The system can&#8217;t recreate these, so it has to use swap space, but iOS doesn&#8217;t have a swap mechanism. So dirty memory will always be kept in physical memory\u00a0until it reach a certain limit.\u00a0Then the app\u00a0will be terminated and all its memory will be\u00a0recycled by system.<\/p>\n<p>Before getting to this point, iOS will send a few warnings to your app so you can act accordingly.<\/p>\n<h3>UIViewController &#8211;\u00a0didReceiveMemoryWarning<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably seen it before, but habitually deleted it. When you create new app or view controller, this is the template Xcode creates for you:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67ce897777625\/]<br \/>\nSee the &#8220;<em>didReceiveMemoryWarning<\/em>&#8221; function? That&#8217;s where iOS will trigger it&#8217;s warning for your view controller. Ahhhh, that&#8217;s what that&#8217;s for \ud83d\ude42 . What you&#8217;ll want to do there is purge any\u00a0of the view controller&#8217;s resources\u00a0you don&#8217;t necessarily need\u00a0any more,\u00a0but can recreate later if so. This is also a good place to purge some cache or database resources so it can be recreated later when needed as well. This is why it is good to create everything in a lazy fashion, so resources are requested as needed, and recreated as needed.<\/p>\n<h3>AppDelegate &#8211;\u00a0applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning<\/h3>\n<p>Implement the <em>applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning<\/em> method of your application delegate. This is where you will set any app-wide references to objects it can safely free to <em>nil<\/em>. Also in the application delegate, make use of the\u00a0<em>applicationDidEnterBackground\u00a0<\/em>to free any resource so your app isn&#8217;t first line to be terminate from the list of background apps.<\/p>\n<h3>NSNotificationCenter &#8211; UIApplicationDidReceiveMemoryWarningNotification<\/h3>\n<p>Subscribe to the <em>NSNotificationCenter<\/em> if this suits better to free up resources:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee67d3084541886\/]<br \/>\nWith one or more of these in place, you can use the simulator to trigger a memory warning by\u00a0choosing <em>Hardware\u00a0&gt;\u00a0Simulate Memory Warning<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>Debugging<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/DeveloperTools\/Conceptual\/InstrumentsUserGuide\/CommonMemoryProblems.html#\/\/apple_ref\/doc\/uid\/TP40004652-CH91-SW1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xcode Instruments<\/a>\u00a0is\u00a0actually quite useful.

It manages memory across the board. In Objective-C for example, Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) is not supported in\u00a0procedural-C code and low-level\u00a0API&#8217;s like Core Graphics. These have been handled in Swift though, so\u00a0the huge memory leaks that a programmer can have in Objective-C are impossible in Swift. This alone is a big win for Swift.

It combines protocol extension and type erasure to give you a solid, flexible dependency injection that works great with unit test and even frameworks.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dependency Container<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing we must do is come up with a container that will house all our dependencies. This will be referenced later from consumers to grab dependencies they want.<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e62085964284\/]<br \/>\nNow that we got the blueprint to our container and its dependency protocols, let&#8217;s implement the concrete dependency instances:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e68420669066\/]<br \/>\nThis is where the main meat of the dependency injection occurs. The dependency objects implement the protocols so the concrete types are hidden from the caller. This way, the dependency types can be swapped out underneath without affecting the rest of the application.<\/p>\n<p>Also notice that some dependencies reference other dependencies within the container. The implications of this is powerful because you are building a dependency graph and any part of it can be changed which will cascade.<\/p>\n<h2>The Dependencies<\/h2>\n<p>There are no singleton dependencies in our container because we always want to deal with immutable objects, otherwise state management will bite you later. Instead, its a factory serving fresh instances. The dependencies are <code>structs<\/code>\u00a0that implement the protocols.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of some of the dependencies:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e6b309109466\/]<br \/>\nWe&#8217;re using classic constructor injection to feed the dependencies in.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<code>HTTPService<\/code>\u00a0dependency handles the raw network requests\/responses and where you would <code>import Alamofire<\/code>\u00a0for example. Never leak your 3rd-party dependencies to the rest of the app! Instead, encapsulate it under one of your custom dependencies. That&#8217;s what <code>HTTPService<\/code>\u00a0will do for <code>Alamofire<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>Now based on our dependency container, <code>HTTPService<\/code>\u00a0gets injected into <code>AuthenticationNetworkService<\/code>\u00a0so it can make the REST API endpoint calls. It doesn&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s using <code>Alamofire<\/code>\u00a0underneath and can be completely swapped out for another network library or <code>URLSession<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>From here, <code>AuthenticationNetworkService<\/code>\u00a0gets injected into <code>AuthenticationWorker<\/code>\u00a0that gets referenced by the rest of the app. This way, the REST API server or endpoints can be completely swapped out and your app wouldn&#8217;t have to know. It would still call the <code>AuthenticationWorker<\/code>\u00a0API&#8217;s.<\/p>\n<h2>The Injection<\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s now time to start using our dependency container. We will use a protocol extension to pass in the dependency container so the caller can start resolving the dependency types it wants.<\/p>\n<p>We need a singleton to hold a reference to the dependency container. So although we couldn&#8217;t get away from singletons altogether, the dependency container is a factory and still serving immutable instances.<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e71085774330\/]<br \/>\nThe <code>DependencyInjector<\/code>\u00a0should be configured early on in the app lifecycle. That way, your frameworks can have its own dependency container, such as <code>CoreDependency<\/code>, and consumers can override any of the dependencies it desires. This works great for consumers who want to use a different\u00a0<code>UserDefaults<\/code>\u00a0app group or Keychain access group.<\/p>\n<p>We do this in the <code>willFinishLaunchingWithOptions<\/code>:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e76572295198\/]<br \/>\nFinally, the protocol extension for <code>HasDependencies<\/code>\u00a0is used to provide the dependency container to whoever wants it:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e78723360930\/]<\/p>\n<h2>The Unit Test<\/h2>\n<p>Not only does this dependency injection work great for frameworks, but of course works great for unit tests. It can be configured on a global and scoped level too!<\/p>\n<p>For the global level of your unit tests, you can create a <code>TestDependency<\/code>\u00a0that subclasses <code>CoreDependency<\/code>:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e7b300557847\/]<br \/>\nYou set this in your <code>setUp()<\/code>\u00a0function of your test case:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e7d756349382\/]<br \/>\nWhat&#8217;s even more powerful is you can create a scoped dependency container for a specific test case, see <code>ScopedDependency<\/code>:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee6e81680440503\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The combination of a dependency container, a protocol extension to expose it, and immutable dependencies give you a pure Swift DI that works well with frameworks and unit tests.

From here, put in the relative path to the <em>.plist<\/em> file with the appended platform name you did earlier:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/CapturFiles_315-500x241.png\" alt=\"Xcode Info.plist Packaging Build Settings\" width=\"500\" height=\"241\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-659\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/CapturFiles_315-500x241.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/CapturFiles_315-768x371.png 768w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/CapturFiles_315-1024x494.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally for the <em>.plist<\/em> files, delete the entry under &#8220;Build Phases &gt; Copy Bundle Sources&#8221;.

The reason is because iOS 8.4 has some goodies not available in previous version, such as support for Apple Watch and security updates. Plus this is just some of the perks of developing for the Apple ecosystem instead of Android <span>\ud83d\ude09<\/span>. Check out your app stats and don&#8217;t end up supporting older version just for one or two people.

It is independent of platforms, frameworks, databases, or UI. It is testable. It&#8217;s a way of life (ok, software life). Sound good?<\/p>\n<p>If you have an hour to spare for learning, I highly suggest watching this lecture called\u00a0<strong>The Principles of Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob Martin<\/strong> <em>(skip to 10:00 if you don&#8217;t want the biology lesson, although still interesting)<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/o_TH-Y78tt4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>A Thing About Screaming Architecture<\/h2>\n<p>Regarding project structure, let&#8217;s first get the feature vs. type debate out the way. The application should scream what it does without any IDE or explanation at all. Anyone should be able to open up the file system and know exactly what the application does.\u00a0Take a look at the two apps below:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/feature-vs-type-project.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"266\" height=\"568\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41299\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In the first app, all it tells me is that it&#8217;s an MVC project and has something to do with products and users. Why do I have to know MVC to figure out what it does? I have to compile and run it in my mind to figure out what it does. What&#8217;s worse, I have to expand all the folders to start investigating. In a complex app, imagine hundreds of controllers or views polluting your eyes. Maintaining and debugging are nightmare too, jumping back and forth between folders is like a game of ping pong.<\/p>\n<p>Now take a look at the second app. Right off the bat, I can tell it lists products, displays it, and shows a user&#8217;s profile. I don&#8217;t have to expand the folders to know what it is. I don&#8217;t have to know what framework or pattern it&#8217;s using. I don&#8217;t even have to know what language it&#8217;s written in!<\/p>\n<p>Another way to look at it is would you rather organize drawers by just throwing everything into three drawers, or is it better to have several\u00a0small well-defined and well-labeled drawers?<\/p>\n<p>Ok let&#8217;s move on&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>The Anatomy of the Clean Architecture<\/h2>\n<p>There are actually many variations and flavours of the Clean Architecture. You&#8217;ve probably heard of <a href=\"https:\/\/mutualmobile.com\/posts\/meet-viper-fast-agile-non-lethal-ios-architecture-framework\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VIPER<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/clean-swift.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Clean Swift<\/a>. When you jump into other platforms like Android or .NET, there even exists more flavours. The one I will show you in this post was <em>heavily<\/em> inspired by Clean Swift. I put my own spin to it after battle-testing it and maintaining it across several teams, platforms, and environments.<\/p>\n<p>To get started, we have to get some terminology out the way. Below are a list of components in the architecture:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>View:<\/strong> The interface where user interactions occur, such as the <code>Storyboard<\/code> or <code>XIB<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Controller:<\/strong> The layer which binds the view to code, this being the <code>UIViewController<\/code> in our case.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Interactor:<\/strong> The business logic layer where the controller must send requests through.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Presenter:<\/strong> The layer that formats the response from the Interactor and sends it back to the controller.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Router:<\/strong> The layer that transports the user to another use case scene, usually an event that occurs in the controller.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The core pieces of the architecture is the <em>Controller, Interactor, and Presenter<\/em>. The important thing to notice is that it has a uni-directional flow!\u00a0This tremendously reduces complexity and makes it easy to manage. Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I have summed up the entire architecture in a single diagram:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Clean-Architecture-Cycle-2-500x518.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"518\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-41346 size-medium\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Follow the flow below to understand how the architecture works:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>User interacts with <strong><em>View<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong><em>Controller<\/em><\/strong> event fires, builds a request model, and calls the <strong><em>Interactor<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The <strong><em>Interactor<\/em><\/strong> calls the underlying core library with all your workers to access the data (could even subscribe to an observable here if needed)<\/li>\n<li>The <strong><em>Interactor<\/em><\/strong> receives data from the worker and wraps it in a response model to send to the <strong><em>Presenter<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The <strong><em>Presenter<\/em><\/strong> calls app-level helpers if needed to format or localize the response and builds a view model to send to the <strong><em>Controller<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>The <strong><em>Controller<\/em><\/strong> receives the view model in a function and binds it to the <strong><em>View<\/em><\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Repeat the cycle&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Also notice the architecture is cross-platform. It doesn&#8217;t care that the view is served by an iOS app, Android app, web browser, or even a REST API endpoint. Once it gets past the view, everything should be identical across platforms. In fact, an iOS and Android app can be eerily similar with just the <code>Storyboard<\/code> vs <code>Layout<\/code> being the difference. Even the iOS\u00a0<code>UIViewController<\/code>\u00a0and Android <code>Activity<\/code>\u00a0code would almost be identical except for the binding logic. This makes collaboration and bug fixing tight between teams!<\/p>\n<h2>The Details<\/h2>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/show_me_the_code.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"306\" height=\"165\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41304\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s time to see how this plays out in code. We can do this by first examining the protocols that is the blueprint for a use case; this is important so the boundaries are defined and components are decoupled:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee761a199507041\/]<br \/>\nHere&#8217;s what happens when the controller loads via <code>viewDidLoad<\/code>: <em>interactor.fetchProducts &gt; presenter.presentFetchedProducts &gt; controller.displayFetchedProducts<\/em>. Do you see it yet? The cycle is there.\u00a0Let&#8217;s take another look&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><em>Controller:<\/em><br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7624972079999\/]<br \/>\nThe controller creates the instances to the interactor, injects the presenter, and also creates the router. When loaded, it creates a request model and calls the interactor:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7627378063017\/]<br \/>\nThe <code>fetchProducts<\/code>\u00a0function in the interactor calls the injected <code>productsWorker<\/code>\u00a0(DI was left out for clarity, see my other post\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/swift-protocol-oriented-dependency-injection\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Swifty Dependency Injection<\/a>\u00a0for that topic). Underneath, it will call the appropriate storage, whether it be Core Data, Realm, or even a file system&#8230; the architecture doesn&#8217;t care and could be swapped out without affecting the cycle! When the data returns from the data storage asynchronously, it will wrap it in a response model and send it to the presenter:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee762c226146659\/]<br \/>\nThe presenter will convert the response into a view model, applying any formatting and localization, and call the controller function to display it. The view model properties are almost always strings because the view will just display.\u00a0If the interactor gave the presenter an error, it will even create a view model out of the error and let the controller display it.<\/p>\n<p>The models are encapsulated in an enum and are only relevant to its own use case. You do not cross boundaries without being wrapped in one of the models:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee762f929010954\/]<br \/>\nFinally the router in case the controller has to send the user to another use case:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7633685550058\/]<br \/>\nThis way, the the controller is decoupled from the routing decisions and can be used from the controller as:\u00a0<code>router.showProduct(for: productID)<\/code>.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The Clean Architecture is flexible, scalable, and maintainable. Although it is more verbose than other architecture designs, it is necessary so components are not tightly coupled. That means everything must reference each other by its protocol, not its concrete types. And when crossing boundaries, data must be wrapped in request \/ response models, or again components will be coupled. In a future post, I will discuss how to unit test the whole stack.<\/p>\n<p>See a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/iosmentor-io\/Swift-Clean-Architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">working example of this Clean Architecture<\/a>\u00a0to try it out for yourself.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>HAPPY CODING!!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">FREE Masterclass Webinar: Creating Cross-Platform Swift Frameworks for iOS, watchOS, &amp; tvOS!<\/h2>\n<p>An essential part of creating scalable apps is code organization.

From push notifications, deep links, theme setup, logger initialization.. the list goes on. Not to mention all the 3rd party SDK&#8217;s who want to plug into your app lifecycle too. Eventually your <code>AppDelegate<\/code>\u00a0looks like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7cfa265762812\/]<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/AppDelegate-Responsibilties.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"414\" height=\"306\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-41258\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This would be a nightmare to maintain. Fortunately, there&#8217;s a better way! It involves shifting the responsibilities to pluggable services.<\/p>\n<h2>Application Services to the Rescue!<\/h2>\n<p>Instead of dumping all the responsibilities on <code>AppDelegate<\/code>, let&#8217;s create an\u00a0<code>ApplicationService<\/code>\u00a0protocol that will plug into the app life cycle. Eventually your app delegate will look this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7d05920971586\/]<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/appdelegate_whoa-2.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"230\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-41267 aligncenter\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Tell Me More!!<\/h2>\n<p>To accomplish this, we first create a protocol the\u00a0<code>AppDelegate<\/code>\u00a0services will conform to:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7d10646192315\/]<br \/>\nThis simply mirrors the <code>AppDelegate<\/code>\u00a0events which we will plug into just a bit. Notice the protocol functions are optional because not all services will need to tap into all the events all the time.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we create a super class for our\u00a0<code>AppDelegate<\/code>\u00a0to bind the events to each of the services:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7d13918443703\/]<br \/>\nWhat&#8217;s happening is the\u00a0<code>services()<\/code>\u00a0function is exposed for the <code>AppDelegate<\/code>\u00a0to override in order to provide the services that want to plug and play. The <code>PluggableApplicationDelegate<\/code> will create a lazy property to prevent multiple instantiation of the services, then will finally call those functions when each of the app event fires.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<code>AppDelegate<\/code>\u00a0inherits from the <code>PluggableApplicationDelegate<\/code> and provides the service instances it desires:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7d19288650515\/]<br \/>\nAnd one of the application services would look something like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee7d1e314024461\/]<br \/>\nNow the <code>AppDelegate<\/code>\u00a0is scalable and maintainable! Instead mixing responsibilities in the same object, your pluggable service binds to the app lifecycle and manages its own processes.<\/p>\n<h2>BONUS: Pluggable UIViewController!<\/h2>\n<p>The <code>UIViewController<\/code>\u00a0can reap the benefits by leveraging the same technique too.

We use this queue&#8217;s async method to write to the array\u00a0and not worry about the result; we asynchronously set it and forget it.\u00a0When reading from the array, we can use the sync method and get the results instantly.<\/p>\n<p>We can still do better though. The reads are not optimized because multiple read requests have to wait for each other in a queue. However, reads should be able to happen concurrently, as long as there isn&#8217;t a write happening at the same time.<\/p>\n<h2>Concurrent Queue Method<\/h2>\n<p>This technique is more elegant and uses a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Readers\u2013writer_lock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared exclusion lock<\/a>\u00a0on the array. We will still use Grand Central Dispatch, but this time with a concurrent queue instead of a serial one.\u00a0That might work for concurrent reads, but we must disallow all concurrency when\u00a0writing. This can be achieved with the <code>barrier<\/code>\u00a0flag for the dispatch queue:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee8966056870876\/]<br \/>\nNotice the <code>async<\/code>\u00a0method has the <code>barrier<\/code>\u00a0flag set for writes. This means no other blocks may be scheduled from the queue while the async\/barrier process\u00a0runs. We continue to use the\u00a0<code>sync<\/code>\u00a0method for reads, but all readers will\u00a0run in parallel this time because of the concurrent queue attribute.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/gcd_barrier-500x162.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"162\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5281\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/gcd_barrier-500x162.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/gcd_barrier-768x249.png 768w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/gcd_barrier-1024x332.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Readers will still be blocked when a <code>barrier<\/code>\u00a0process is running though.

The limitations of delegates quickly reveal itself when you need multiple delegates. They&#8217;re also pretty awkward in a functional programming language like Swift. Let&#8217;s use this pattern to wrap <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/reference\/corelocation\/cllocationmanager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CLLocationManager<\/a> to allow callers to subscribe to events instead of using\u00a0shared delegate functions.<\/p>\n<h2>Out of the Box<\/h2>\n<p>First to contrast, see how we can use <code>CLLocationManager<\/code>\u00a0in a view controller:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee8ff2615188576\/]<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s nothing special\u00a0here;\u00a0just a few <code>IBActions<\/code>\u00a0to request authorization, request current location, and toggle the location updates. This calls the underlying <code>CLLocationManager<\/code>\u00a0to perform the actions as normal.\u00a0Then in the delegate functions, we handle the response from the location services.<\/p>\n<h2>Delegate to Closure Pattern<\/h2>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s add some sugar and spice to our <code>CLLocationManager<\/code>. In the end, we can do something like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee8ff9381682013\/]<br \/>\nNotice no more delegate functions! Instead, the trailing closures are added to the request authorization and location calls:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee8ffc924176165\/]<br \/>\nAlso, the custom <code>LocationManager<\/code>\u00a0allows subscriptions to be registered for later execution when ready in an observable manner. For example, we can subscribe to\u00a0location updates by appending the closure to the &#8220;delegate queue&#8221;:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee8fff179731656\/]<br \/>\nThis will fire any time location updates come in. It&#8217;s not just Swifty, but very powerful. Several subscriptions can be registered from anywhere and will all be executed.<\/p>\n<p>Also notice there is an <code>Observer<\/code>\u00a0type that is used to wrap the closures. The reason for this is there isn&#8217;t a way to make closures <code>Equatable<\/code>\u00a0in Swift. However, this is necessary so the observers can be &#8220;unsubscribed&#8221; from the observable (or the queue). With this in place, unsubscribing from the observable becomes as simple as this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9001431974703\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Show Me the Money!<\/h2>\n<p>The custom <code>LocationManager<\/code>\u00a0is implemented below. Notice it is using <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/creating-thread-safe-arrays-in-swift\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">thread-safe queues<\/a> to store the closures for later execution by the location manager services.<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9003082383450\/]<br \/>\nAnd the simple <code>Observer<\/code>\u00a0type to workaround equatable closures:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9009976231478\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Breaking It Down<\/h2>\n<p>In the custom <code>LocationManager<\/code>, the <code>CLLocationManager<\/code>\u00a0is kept private\u00a0internally. Then we route the internal delegate calls to the closure queues for execution, which will notify the listeners who&#8217;ve subscribed.<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9014693544862\/]<br \/>\nWe are keeping a queue of\u00a0closures to execute all the time in an observable manner, and the other queue is for single requests like <code>requestLocation,<\/code>\u00a0which will called and removed to prevent duplicate firing. The delegates execute the closures in the arrays:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9016998661015\/]<br \/>\nWith these in place, the closures can be added to the location manager to be held in queue until the delegate functions fire them:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9019805124608\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Requesting Authorization<\/h2>\n<p>A tricky area is requesting authorization since there are several states the user&#8217;s authorization can fall into. For this reason, this custom <code>LocationManager<\/code>\u00a0has a smarter authorization request implementation:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee901b943338904\/]<br \/>\nA few things\u00a0come into play with this extended <code>requestAuthorization<\/code>\u00a0function:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The permission type\u00a0needed is handled by an enum parameter: <code>requestAuthorization(for: .whenInUse)<\/code>. This way, calling <code>requestWhenInUseAuthorization<\/code> or <code>requestAlwaysAuthorization<\/code> is abstracted away.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>startUpdating<\/code>\u00a0boolean parameter automatically starts the location update services after authorization is offered to the user. It is queued up in the <code>didChangeAuthorization<\/code> when needed to ensure it is called after authorization has been given.<\/li>\n<li>If the required authorization is already given, everything is ignored and start updates occur if specified.<\/li>\n<li>If the authorization is already given, but is not the level\u00a0requested, it will start updates immediately since this can still occur, but will return false in the callback to specify the requested authorization is not given.<\/li>\n<li>If the authorization is denied, it will queue up start updates for later execution.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The request authorization can now conveniently be used like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee901e578615650\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Shared Singleton<\/h2>\n<p>Many times, a single <code>CoreLocation<\/code> manager is needed for your entire app. This helps in conserving power and simplifying data\u00a0flow. For this reason, the following pattern was created. In the <code>AppDelegate<\/code>, we add the static location manager:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9023471213289\/]<br \/>\nWith this global location manager in place and lazily loaded, view controllers can reference the location manager like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9025139312042\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>The <code>CLLocationManager<\/code>\u00a0has been wrapped in a modern, Swifty closure-based pattern.

The game changed and Apple&#8217;s coding conventions are making a slow shift to becoming\u00a0more Swifty.\u00a0In this post, I&#8217;m going to illustrate how we can convert\u00a0delegates to\u00a0a closures-based pattern.<\/p>\n<h2>What About Delegates?<\/h2>\n<p>Although delegates are powerful, it&#8217;s a bit archaic.\u00a0With reactive and event-driven programing, delegates\u00a0breaks down and lose its elegance.\u00a0See this\u00a0simple delegate pattern example below. Notice\u00a0how the <code>completed<\/code>\u00a0flag gets propagated back to the parent object who was passed into the <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0initializer:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9426328871043\/]<br \/>\nThe <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0objects were\u00a0instantiated in\u00a0<code>MyParentController<\/code>\u00a0and passed itself in as the delegate. It accepted\u00a0the delegate as\u00a0a specific protocol called <code>TodoDelegate<\/code>. This protocol will indicate to the <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0object what properties and functions the\u00a0delegate has.<\/p>\n<p>In the <code>complete<\/code>\u00a0property of <code>Todo<\/code>, the <code>didSet<\/code>\u00a0event calls the delegate&#8217;s <code>completed<\/code>\u00a0function. It knows that the\u00a0<code>completed<\/code>\u00a0function is there because <code>MyParentController<\/code>\u00a0adopts <code>TodoDelegate<\/code>.<\/p>\n<p>This\u00a0is\u00a0where delegates\u00a0breaks down. The <code>completed<\/code>\u00a0function in <code>MyParentController<\/code>\u00a0is being shared for all <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0objects. I have to put a <code>switch<\/code>\u00a0statement there to find the one who triggered it and perform the customized action for it.\u00a0What if we we&#8217;re listening to\u00a0hundreds of\u00a0<code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0objects, that <code>switch<\/code>\u00a0statement would get out of control. Even besides this, it feels weird\u00a0that the <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0object and the triggered function are in two different places.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/awkward_meme.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-5570\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/awkward_meme.jpg 400w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/awkward_meme-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Delegates to Closure Pattern<\/h2>\n<p>We will now convert the above delegate pattern to a closure-based one. This fits more into the functional programming paradigm. Instead of a delegate function getting\u00a0triggered, we will allow callers to &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to the\u00a0<code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0object. The subscriptions will take a closure and queue it for later execution when ready:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee942d277736432\/]<br \/>\nWe got rid of the delegate protocol completely. In fact, the <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0objects doesn&#8217;t\u00a0even need a reference to\u00a0<code>MyParentController<\/code>\u00a0at all!\u00a0Instead, the caller subscribes to the todo&#8217;s events:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9436462806473\/]<br \/>\nThis is great because now the focus\u00a0is on the <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0object. It makes more sense to attach a closure to the <code>Todo<\/code>\u00a0object itself instead of defining it somewhere else in a shared delegate function.<\/p>\n<p>During the <code>subscribe<\/code>\u00a0process, it stores this closure into a queue to be called later when ready:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9439452320995\/]<br \/>\nWhen it&#8217;s time to trigger the event, it executes the closures\u00a0in the queue one by one:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee943b783179657\/]<br \/>\n<img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/brilliant_meme.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"350\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5571\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>What About Thread-Safety?<\/h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s one complication you must handle. The queue is simply an array of closures. This can be dangerous if subscriptions were to happen from multiple threads. Therefore, we need some locking or exclusivity mechanism on the queue. The good news is I have already done this in another post called <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/creating-thread-safe-arrays-in-swift\/\" target=\"_blank\">Creating Thread-Safe Arrays in Swift<\/a>.\u00a0We can use the <code>SynchronizedArray<\/code>\u00a0from there for our queue type:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee943d532910972\/]<br \/>\nEverything else stays the same because the <code>SynchronizedArray<\/code>\u00a0has many of the same API&#8217;s as a regular array, but is thread-safe!<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Although this was a simple example, the delegate to closure pattern can be applied to more complex scenarios.\u00a0For example, imagine you can subscribe to GPS location updates instead of sharing a single delegate function:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9440180006474\/]<br \/>\nThis becomes even more useful for shared singletons which\u00a0can only accept one delegate,\u00a0instead of being able to trigger multiple delegates. In a future post, I&#8217;ll convert delegates to closures for native Apple managers like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/reference\/corelocation\/cllocationmanager\" target=\"_blank\">CLLocationManager<\/a>\u00a0and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/reference\/corebluetooth\/cbcentralmanager\" target=\"_blank\">CBCentralManager<\/a>.

The framework structure will look like this:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_126-335x800.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"335\" height=\"800\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1740\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_126-335x800.png 335w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_126-429x1024.png 429w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_126.png 620w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 335px) 100vw, 335px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Now we have a place\u00a0to code!<\/p>\n<h2>The Configuration<\/h2>\n<p>Before we go much further, we need a simple and manageable\u00a0way to store configuration values. I cover how we can read values from a plist file in my <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/reading-values-plist-bundle-swift\/\" target=\"_blank\">previous post<\/a>. In the end, our plist configuration file will look something like this:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_122-500x363.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"363\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1734\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_122-500x363.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_122-768x558.png 768w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_122-1024x744.png 1024w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_122.png 1062w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>This way, apps consuming the framework only have to set a few configuration values in a plist file to wire it to their WordPress site, as well as add some look and feel changes. This will get read into memory when the app starts up:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d00214465569\/]<br \/>\nThis is extending\u00a0Apple&#8217;s native &#8220;<em>UserDefaults<\/em>&#8221; function called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/reference\/foundation\/userdefaults\/1417065-register\" target=\"_blank\">register(defaults:)<\/a>&#8221; to store a dictionary into the user defaults. In this case, it&#8217;s first converting the plist into a dictionary, then using the underlying native &#8220;<em>register<\/em>&#8221; call to store the values into user defaults for later use.<\/p>\n<h2>Ground Zero: The Database<\/h2>\n<p>An application is only as good as its data. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to think of what the data schema will look like. Seeing what the WordPress JSON looks like out of the box, things can get messy and confusing. Instead, I&#8217;d like to extend the new <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/rest-api\/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress REST API<\/a> to provide my own slim, simplified endpoint:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_119-500x572.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"572\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1722\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_119-500x572.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_119-768x879.png 768w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_119-894x1024.png 894w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_119.png 1394w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, the new REST API is super flexible and well thought out to do this. Below is\u00a0the WordPress extension point to make this happen, or\u00a0you can install my\u00a0WordPress <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ZamzamInc\/SwiftyPress-WP\" target=\"_blank\">SwiftyPress plugin<\/a>\u00a0to get it done\u00a0(ya, it&#8217;s in PHP):<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d07707583287\/]<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s mostly boilerplate code, but now I get my own route with endpoints and schemas.

So\u00a0we need a way to persist this data locally in the app to ensure it works offline;\u00a0for this we will use <a href=\"http:\/\/realm.io\/docs\/swift\/latest\/\" target=\"_blank\">Realm<\/a>. Here&#8217;s\u00a0how the database will look like\u00a0in the app:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_121-500x210.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"210\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1731\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_121-500x210.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_121-768x323.png 768w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_121-1024x430.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>The Models<\/h2>\n<p>We have our\u00a0database and the endpoints to update it, now we can start designing our Swift models. Let&#8217;s first start with the &#8220;<em>Post<\/em>&#8221; model:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d11091919753\/]<br \/>\nNotice my &#8220;<em>convenient init<\/em>&#8220;, where I can instantiate the model from JSON. I&#8217;m using a Swifty library called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/delba\/JASON\" target=\"_blank\">JASON<\/a>, but you can choose another library or manually do the conversion.<\/p>\n<p>You can see the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ZamzamInc\/SwiftyPress\/tree\/master\/Sources\/Models\" target=\"_blank\">source code for the other models<\/a>, but basically I created models for: <em>Media (images), Post, Term (categories and tags), and User (author)<\/em>.<\/p>\n<h2>The Service<\/h2>\n<p>We need a way to query the data from the local Realm and remote WordPress databases. We can create a centralized service per model to do this, such as &#8220;<em>PostService<\/em>&#8220;:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d16069782982\/]<br \/>\nThe first &#8220;<em>get<\/em>&#8221; function retrieves the posts from the local Realm database. We will also need the &#8220;<em>getFromRemote<\/em>&#8221; function to retrieve data from the cloud (WordPress), which passes in\u00a0the remote JSON to the model&#8217;s <em>convenient init<\/em>\u00a0to be saved into Realm later.<\/p>\n<p>To make things maintainable and more elegant, I created a &#8220;<em>PostRouter<\/em>&#8221; that houses all our REST API calls via\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Alamofire\/Alamofire#routing-requests\" target=\"_blank\">Alamofire&#8217;s nifty &#8220;<span class=\"s1\"><em>URLRequestConvertible<\/em>&#8221; protocol<\/span><\/a>. This way, the\u00a0REST API calls can be changed and managed in one place:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d19594784334\/]<br \/>\nThis allows me to query the REST API services without knowing the URL or parameters all the time. We&#8217;re ready to connect the pipes to seed the database.<\/p>\n<h2>App Lift Off!<\/h2>\n<p>In the launch of the app, we will seed the fresh database with posts saved from the server. In &#8220;<em>AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions<\/em>&#8221; we will check if the database exists. The first time it will need to be created and seeded with data.<\/p>\n<p>To do this, we will need a function on our &#8220;<em>PostService<\/em>&#8221; to update the local data from the remote server. A good way to do this is to query the posts sorted by descending modified date order, then merge them into Realm if the local modified date is older than the server or doesn&#8217;t exist at all:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d1d792114819\/]<br \/>\nIt retrieves the JSON from WordPress, compares the <em>modified<\/em> property to the local post model in Realm, then persists it if it is older or doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n<p>This is great for updating the last few posts, but seeding the database from scratch will need to be handled different since there can be hundreds or even thousands of posts. We can do this using a recursive function that persists\u00a0posts via pagination:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d20735473901\/]<br \/>\nThis function calls the previous &#8220;<em>updateFromRemote<\/em>&#8221; function several times until there are no more pages left. Run this function called\u00a0<span>&#8220;<\/span><em>PostService.seedFromRemote<\/em><span>&#8221;\u00a0<\/span>in the\u00a0<span>&#8220;<\/span><em>AppDelegate.didFinishLaunchingWithOptions<\/em><span>&#8221; so the recursive scraping begins!<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Optimizing the App Startup<\/h4>\n<p>We can achieve\u00a0a huge performance boost\u00a0by running the app\u00a0in our development environment and get the completed database from the app to use as a seed database for new app installs. This is much more performant to copy the seed database instead of querying the data page-by-page and parsing it. Here&#8217;s the function you can use to copy the seed database to the user&#8217;s Realm space:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d22614698221\/]<br \/>\nIt checks if the Realm database exists. If it doesn&#8217;t, it will look for the seed database to copy to the user&#8217;s Realm database path. It will fallback to our recursive function that will seed the database from cloud via REST API and pagination if the seed database doesn&#8217;t exist.<\/p>\n<p>The seeding of the database should\u00a0also be running in the &#8220;<em>AppDelegate<\/em>&#8220;. However, it\u00a0must be run on first installs only or the database will be overwritten every time. I&#8217;m using a neat library called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/KyleGoslan\/UpdateKit\" target=\"_blank\">UpdateKit<\/a> to know when the app is freshly installed or even when the app updates:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d25547673306\/]<\/p>\n<h4>Keeping Posts Updated<\/h4>\n<p>For subsequent new or modified\u00a0posts, we will read the last 50 modified posts in the view controller&#8217;s load in a throttled manner using a great library called <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/soffes\/RateLimit\" target=\"_blank\">RateLimit<\/a>:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d28097501041\/]<br \/>\nGreat, now we should everything we need to build the rest of the app!<\/p>\n<h2>The UI<\/h2>\n<p>Since a few pages will need to display posts, such favorites, most popular, and just browsing all or by category, we should create a couple base classes. One for tables and another for collections. Here&#8217;s what the base table class called &#8220;<em>RealmPostTableViewController<\/em>&#8221; looks like:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d2a806212410\/]<br \/>\nTo create the counterpart collection base class, I&#8217;m using a protocol called &#8220;<em>RealmControllable<\/em>&#8221;\u00a0<span>to unify the table and collection views. I\u00a0cover this<\/span>\u00a0in\u00a0my previous post\u00a0called &#8220;<em><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/protocol-oriented-tableview-collectionview\/\" target=\"_blank\">Protocol-Oriented TableView and CollectionView in Swift<\/a><\/em>&#8220;.<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d2d612158981\/]<br \/>\nThe Realm &#8220;<em>NotificationToken<\/em>&#8221; is wiring up the\u00a0database updates reactively to the table or collection views. When an update happens in the database, it reloads the UI automatically. Also, there is filter and sort functions that the derived view controllers can use easily.<\/p>\n<p>For the table cell, we are simply binding the data to the cell view and configuring its style:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d30889086331\/]<br \/>\nFinally for the view controller, we will end up with\u00a0something\u00a0super lightweight and flexible:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d33078057850\/]<br \/>\nWe can use this rapid development pattern for all our view controllers that need to display a list of posts. For example, here&#8217;s one that displays a user&#8217;s favorite posts:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d35566530635\/]<\/p>\n<h2>The\u00a0App<\/h2>\n<p>After getting all our framework pieces in place, our apps will be super lightweight but still configurable. Here&#8217;s what an app using the framework will look like:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_124.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"484\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1737\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s incredibly light! Updating the framework underneath would update the all apps across all our projects at once. For wiring it to the framework, all that&#8217;s needed is the &#8220;<em>Settings.plist<\/em>&#8221; to store your app and WordPress configurations, and an HTML file\u00a0used as a template for your post detail views (using <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/kylef\/Stencil\" target=\"_blank\">Stencil<\/a> to bind the values to the HTML). Of course,\u00a0finally the AppDelegate code to glue the framework to the app&#8217;s lifecycle:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297ee9d39953932454\/]<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s it! Here&#8217;s what the app looks like with only a few files in the app source code:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/CapturFiles_125.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"391\" height=\"508\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Although this post was about WordPress, the concepts are generic enough to extend the framework to support different providers. This would allow integrating\u00a0other CMS or REST endpoint with the same code. As long as the JSON structure is the same then you&#8217;re good, but even the JSON structure can be abstracted away under each provider model for even more flexibility.<\/p>\n<p>To view the full working source code, see <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ZamzamInc\/SwiftyPress\" target=\"_blank\">SwiftyPress GitHub repo<\/a>.

This becomes especially important when building screens from a Sketch or Photoshop\u00a0design.\u00a0It would be ridiculous for a designer to build a design per screen size, such as iPhone 4, 5, 6, iPad 2, Pro, etc. It&#8217;s not even possible for the Android world. So the margins and spaces must be responsive or relative using percentages, not points.<\/p>\n<p>One can use proportionate widths against any\u00a0view to give the effect\u00a0of percentage-based margins. However, there&#8217;s an important scenario that cannot be achieved with this.

The community has resolved it using one of two techniques:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Programmatically creating layout constraints in code: <em>NSLayoutConstraint(item: myView1,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> attribute: .Bottom,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> relatedBy: .Equal,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> toItem: myView2,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> attribute: .Top,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> multiplier: 1,<\/em><br \/>\n<em> constant: view.bounds.width * 0.05)<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Creating invisible views as spacers with width\/height and specifying a multiplier against the controller view\u00a0size.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There must be a better way&#8230;<\/p>\n<h2>Extending NSLayoutConstraint<\/h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s subclass <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/AppKit\/Reference\/NSLayoutConstraint_Class\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>NSLayoutConstraint<\/em><\/a> so we can use this new class in Storyboard and specify percentage margins instead.

This will be used to specify the margin percentage relative to the screen view and will be done in the &#8220;<em>awakeFromNib<\/em>&#8221; to update the existing constant. See here for the newly created subclass:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea298186424423\/]<br \/>\nActually, in the &#8220;<em>awakeFromNib<\/em>&#8221; I&#8217;m subscribing to the &#8220;<em>UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification<\/em>&#8221; event so any time the layout changes, the new constant is recreated. It will always fire the first time, so this will call the\u00a0&#8220;<em>layoutDidChange<\/em>&#8221; function early on.\u00a0Here is where the main logic happens.<\/p>\n<p>In &#8220;<em>layoutDidChange<\/em>&#8220;, it is taking the specified &#8220;<em>marginPercentage<\/em>&#8221; value from Storyboard and multiplying it against the screen width or height. If the margin percentage is to be calculated for the sides of the view, it will calculate the percentage based on the screen width. Likewise, if the margin percentage is for the top or bottom of the view, it will calculate the percentage based on the screen height.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, it will use this calculated value to stuff in\u00a0the constant property for the layout constraint.\u00a0Since this logic is triggered every time there is an orientation change, it will fire before the Auto Layout kicks in, which is vital it happens before. What this means is that the constant is being overwritten from what was specified in Storyboard before Auto Layout lays out the views.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where the caveat is&#8230; the constants in the Storyboard are not used at runtime, but instead are overwritten with the percentage based calculation. So it does require some duplicate effort, once to actually layout the views on Storyboard based on points just so you get a sense of what the screen layout looks like, then percentages\u00a0kick in at runtime.<\/p>\n<p>Maybe a small price to pay compared to specifying constraints in code or invisible views. What are your thoughts&#8230; acceptable trade-off, or could\u00a0there be a\u00a0better way?<\/p>\n"},{"id":711,"title":"Swift Utility Belt Series: Introduction","slug":"swift-utility-belt-series-part-1","type":"post","excerpt":"Swift is a powerful and fun language.

How many times have you needed to get the first item in a collection that matches a particular predicate? Normally you would do this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4e2083798349\/]<br \/>\nA bit annoying that I have to filter first. Why not make &#8220;<em>first<\/em>&#8221; accept a predicate? Now you can by extending the &#8220;<em>SequenceType<\/em>&#8221; protocol:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4e7302739072\/]<br \/>\nNow you can do this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4ea782247350\/]<br \/>\nYou can follow the same logic to create one for &#8220;<em>last<\/em>&#8221; by making the for-loop go in reverse. Thanks to <a href=\"https:\/\/bigonotetaking.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/22\/using-higher-order-methods-everywhere\/\">bigonotetaking<\/a> for this one.<\/p>\n<p>While on the subject of collections, grabbing an item from an array can be risky business. If your index is out of range:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4ed906617406\/]<br \/>\n&#8230;then ?! Your app crashes from a simple problem. Instead, let&#8217;s leverage the power of optionals. This next extension will add a function to all arrays that returns the item or <em>nil<\/em> if it doesn&#8217;t exist (instead of crashing):<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4f1332072188\/]<br \/>\nNow you can safely retrieve an item by index:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4f3593961088\/]<\/p>\n<h2>View Controllers<\/h2>\n<p>In the future, I&#8217;ll keep these posts short and sweet. Since this is an intro to the series, I&#8217;d like to give you a taste of what&#8217;s to come though. So in this next example, I&#8217;ll extend the &#8220;<em>UIViewController<\/em>&#8220;.<\/p>\n<p>How many times have you needed to display an alert message, but dreaded the thought of the amount of verbose code Apple requires you to write:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4f6686812276\/]<br \/>\nThis has irritated me long enough so\u00a0I created an extension for it with a rich set of optional parameters:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4f8268536114\/]<br \/>\nNow you can simply do this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4fc506790326\/]<br \/>\nSweet, huh? Thanks JavaScript \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n<p>You can even take this concept to the &#8220;<em>WKInterfaceController<\/em>&#8221; on\u00a0<em>watchOS<\/em>:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea4fe765028132\/]<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s much more interesting on the watch because the &#8220;<em>alertControllerStyle<\/em>&#8221; produces vastly different alerts, all wrapped in the same extension with a simple <em>enum<\/em> parameter.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>As you can see with the collection samples, extending protocols\u00a0is far reaching and makes them magically show up in code everywhere. You can even apply pattern matching on the extensions to zero in on what kind of types they should be applied to instead of a blanket approach. This produces a clean and intendful API and what really sets Swift apart from other languages.\u00a0I hope you enjoyed these\u00a0goodies and you have an idea of what&#8217;s to come.

Take a look at my <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/swift-class-inheritance\/\">other post for more details<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The initialization rules are there for very good reasons, but sometimes it can make things tedious. For example, in the &#8220;<em>UIViewController<\/em>&#8221; class, there are 2 initializers you must handle since the view controller\u00a0can be instantiated programmatically or through the storyboard. What this means is redundant code will be present like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eea70b273740955\/]<br \/>\nThe compiler is requiring me to declare values for &#8220;<em>videoPlayer<\/em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>videoPlayerLayer<\/em>&#8221; before calling &#8220;<em>super.init<\/em>&#8220;. It&#8217;s happening in two initializers. This is just a simple example, but you can imagine how the repeated code can get out of hand with more complex initialization needs.<\/p>\n<p>Your first thought may be: why not wrap it in a function and call the function from both initializers.

You do not even get any kind of error;\u00a0it just silently passes through without any indication of an issue.<\/p>\n<h2>What the Hack?<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes you need to schedule a notification from the Apple Watch since some kind of interaction happened there, or your app is primarily a watch app with maybe a few configuration screens on the iPhone.\u00a0To get around the limitation, you must get the Apple Watch to communicate to the iPhone to schedule the notification.\u00a0Thankfully Apple added <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/WatchKit\/Reference\/WKInterfaceController_class\/#\/\/apple_ref\/occ\/clm\/WKInterfaceController\/openParentApplication:reply:\" target=\"_blank\">WKInterfaceController.openParentApplication<\/a> to the WatchKit API at the last minute after a lot of commotion in the dev community. Here&#8217;s how to use it:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeaa9d798397527\/]<br \/>\nThis will trigger an event in the iPhone&#8217;s <em>AppDelegate<\/em>, then you can do whatever you like.

This is what you would do on the iPhone&#8217;s <em>AppDelegate<\/em>:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeaaa2474910142\/]<br \/>\nThis new\u00a0<em>handleWatchKitExtensionRequest<\/em>\u00a0function gets triggered by WatchKit on demand, as we did in the <em>awakeWithContext\u00a0<\/em>of the Apple Watch.

Normally with other languages, class inheritance is easy to pick up and just a matter of syntax. However, Swift provides an elaborate\u00a0set of inheritance concepts\u00a0that doesn&#8217;t exist in many other languages. It\u00a0is almost impossible to just <em>&#8220;pick up&#8221;<\/em> without reading the <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/book\/the-swift-programming-language\/id881256329?mt=11\" target=\"_blank\">details in the documentation<\/a>. So in this post, I&#8217;d like to shed light on all the inheritance goodies in Swift.<\/p>\n<h2>Getting Started<\/h2>\n<p>For due diligence, let&#8217;s look at a simple class inheritance example in Swift:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eead92625409209\/]<br \/>\nNothing earth-shattering here&#8230; typical class inheritance as any other language with different syntax. It has a constructor called <em>&#8220;init&#8221;<\/em>, base class implementations can have an\u00a0<em>&#8220;override&#8221;<\/em>, and the base class can be called using the <em>&#8220;super&#8221;<\/em> keyword. However, notice that all properties have to have a value, whether it be in the property declaration or in the initializers (I&#8217;ll talk more about this in a bit).<\/p>\n<p>If this is all there was to class inheritance in Swift, it would be sufficient. Swift doesn&#8217;t stop there though. There are several more inheritance concepts that Swift provides at your disposal.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/class-inheritance-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"class-inheritance-beyond\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-645\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/class-inheritance-beyond.jpg 400w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/class-inheritance-beyond-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Inheritance Lifecycle<\/h2>\n<p>First, let&#8217;s understand that\u00a0the inheritance process in Swift is actually split up into two phases:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>first phase<\/em><\/span>, all class\u00a0properties in the inheritance chain are assigned an initial value. This can be\u00a0done in the property\u00a0declaration or class\u00a0initializers.<\/li>\n<li>Once all properties have an initial value, the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>second phase<\/em><\/span> begins. This phase gives\u00a0each class an\u00a0opportunity to update\u00a0its properties or instance further.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The\u00a0two-phase initialization prevents property values from being accessed before they are initialized, and prevents property values from being\u00a0unintentionally\u00a0overwritten.<\/p>\n<h2>Compiler Safety-Checks<\/h2>\n<p>Trying to keep track over which properties have been set to fulfill the phase at the right time would be daunting for large classes. So Swift&#8217;s compiler performs four helpful safety-checks to make sure that two-phase initialization is completed without error.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A designated initializer (or constructor that calls a super constructor) must ensure that all of the properties introduced by its class are initialized before it delegates up to a superclass initializer.<\/li>\n<li>A designated initializer must delegate up to a superclass initializer before assigning a value to an inherited property. If it doesn\u2019t, the new value the designated initializer assigns will be overwritten by the superclass as part of its own initialization.<\/li>\n<li>A convenience initializer (or constructor\u00a0that calls one of its own\u00a0constructors) must delegate to another initializer before assigning a value to <em>any<\/em> property. If it doesn\u2019t, the new value can\u00a0be overwritten by initializer it delegates to.<\/li>\n<li>An initializer cannot call any instance methods, read the values of any instance properties, or refer to self as a value until after the first phase of initialization is complete.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Designated and Convenience Initializers?<\/h2>\n<p>The terms\u00a0<em>&#8220;designated and convenience initializers&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0were briefly mentioned in the last section, but I&#8217;d like to go more in depth about what these kinds of constructors actually mean.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Designated initializer<\/em>\u00a0are constructors that fully initializes all properties introduced by that class and calls a superclass initializer to continue the initialization process. Every class must have at least one designated initializer. If none are\u00a0implemented, then <em>&#8220;init()&#8221;<\/em> is implicitly created.<\/li>\n<li><em>Convenience initializer<\/em>\u00a0call a designated initializer from the same class. This allows you to leverage\u00a0other initializers in your class so you don&#8217;t have to set\u00a0values for all the class properties again, but would like to extend or modify the properties or instance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of the code in action:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eead9a381315861\/]<br \/>\nIn the code above, I&#8217;ve added a new initializer that accepts a parameter to update the <em>&#8220;passengerCount&#8221;<\/em> property during initialization. It immediately delegates across to another initializer (using <em>self.init<\/em> not <em>super.init<\/em>). It&#8217;s <em>&#8220;convenient&#8221;<\/em> because it\u00a0effectively passes on the burden to another\u00a0initializer for\u00a0setting properties as required by one of the compiler safety-checks. The <em>&#8220;convenience initializer&#8221;<\/em> is not required to do anything, but allows you to extend existing initializers.<\/p>\n<h2>Automatic Initializers<\/h2>\n<p>A major difference between Swift inheritance and other languages is that initializers are <em>NOT<\/em> inherited by default. You have to explicitly override initializers in the subclass using the <em>&#8220;override&#8221;<\/em> keyword in front of the initializer. This may seem tedious, but there are certain situation where initializers are inherited automatically:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>If a\u00a0subclass doesn\u2019t define any designated initializers, it automatically inherits all of its superclass designated initializers.<\/li>\n<li>If a\u00a0subclass provides an implementation of all of its superclass designated initializers\u2014either by inheriting them as per the rule above, or by providing a custom implementation as part of its definition\u2014then it automatically inherits all of the superclass convenience initializers as well.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example. The subclass in the following example inherits all of its superclass initializers:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eead9e524161084\/]<br \/>\nNotice there are no initializers in <em>&#8220;Ship&#8221;<\/em>. This allows all initializers from the superclass to be inherited automatically without having to explicitly override them.<\/p>\n<p>In this next example, the initializers are not automatically inherited anymore:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeada0028574328\/]<br \/>\nI&#8217;ve added an <em>&#8220;init&#8221;<\/em> initializer in the subclass. Now all other initializers are no longer inherited, so <em>&#8220;Ship(hasEngine: false)&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0cannot be called\u00a0and it will give a compile error.<\/p>\n<p>However, adding only convenient initializers will not break the rule and will still allow all initializers from the superclass to be automatically inherited. The rules say that you must either have no or all <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>designated<\/em><\/span> initializers defined in your subclass for automatic initializer inheritance to kick in. Here&#8217;s an example where initializers from the subclass would still be inherited:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeada3382157118\/]<br \/>\nI just added a <em>&#8220;convenience initializer&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0to the <em>&#8220;Ship&#8221;<\/em> class. This still satisfies the automatic initializer inheritance rules and allows me to call the superclass initializer with the <em>&#8220;hasEngine&#8221;<\/em> parameter for\u00a0the\u00a0subclass initialization.<\/p>\n<h2>Failable Initializers<\/h2>\n<p>This is a very handy type of initializer. Sometimes one\u00a0would like to return a\u00a0<em>&#8220;nil&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0instance if some conditions are not met. In other languages, I&#8217;d be forced to create a static\u00a0instance factory, such as <em>Vehicle.createInstance()<\/em>, that would either return the instance or a null. This works, but Swift has a native way of handling this called <em>failable initializers<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The syntax would be to add a question mark (?) after the initializer name to indicate\u00a0that this particular initializer can return a <em>&#8220;nil&#8221;<\/em>:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeada6645384706\/]<br \/>\nIn the above example, the initializer <em>&#8220;init?(serialNumber: String?)&#8221;<\/em> has a <em>guard<\/em> statement that checks whether <em>serialNumber<\/em> is nil or empty. If it is, it will return nil for the entire instance. Note that a\u00a0failable initializer creates an optional value of the type it initializes.<\/p>\n<h2>Required Initializers<\/h2>\n<p>Required initializers indicate that every subclass of the class must implement that initializer. For example:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeada8559018546\/]<br \/>\nThe subclass is required to implement an initializer of\u00a0<em>&#8220;required init(manufacturer: String)&#8221;<\/em>. Note that automatic initializer inheritance rules still apply, so if those rules pass, required initializers are also inherited as well and do not have to be explicitly implemented in those scenarios.<\/p>\n<h2>Deinitializers<\/h2>\n<p>Swift automatically deallocates your instances when they are no longer needed to free up resources. Usually\u00a0you don\u2019t need to do any\u00a0manual clean-up when instances are deallocated. It would be useful if you could though, such as closing a file or caching a user&#8217;s state. Swift has you covered:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeadab924125407\/]<br \/>\nA\u00a0deinitializer is called immediately before a class instance is deallocated. You cannot\u00a0explicitly call a deinitializer yourself since the system calls it automatically. Deinitializers are also inherited by subclasses, which could\u00a0also implement their own deinitializers (they would be called in sequence until it reaches the root superclass).<\/p>\n<h2>The Big Kahuna<\/h2>\n<p>There are so many rules and conventions in Swift inheritance, enough to make your head spin. So for the grand finale to this post, I&#8217;d like to include a massive code sample that illustrates\u00a0just about all of the inheritance rules in one snippet with comments and a console output, so you can study it, plug it into the Swift playground, and see it play out:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeadae823127363\/]<br \/>\nHere is the console output to the first initialization, <code>Ship(passengerCount: 50)<\/code>. This way, you can trace\u00a0the sequence of events:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeadb3349621639\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Object-oriented programming has been the cornerstone for software architecture for\u00a0decades. Not much has changed in those years, but Swift proved there is still room to introduce unique concepts to class inheritance. Not only are these Swift inheritance tools powerful, but\u00a0they also enforce safe and intentful code. As a bonus, if you do not follow the inheritance rules, then most of the time the compiler will give you an error or warning right away.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>HAPPY CODING!!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":676,"title":"Protocol Conformance Extensions in Swift","slug":"protocol-conformance-extension-swift","type":"post","excerpt":"Swift is a unique language that has some revolutionary ideas.

This is the best relationship Apple decided to give between the two; yippie it scrolls! Instead, I&#8217;d like to take on another perspective; they both are <em>containers of data<\/em>. So the first thing I&#8217;d like to do is create a new protocol called &#8220;<em>DataViewable<\/em>&#8221; and force the table and collection views to conform to it (see my previous post about <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/protocol-conformance-extension-swift\/\">Protocol Conformance Extensions<\/a>):<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb32f847836059\/]<br \/>\nBoth the table and collection views already have the &#8220;<em>reloadData<\/em>&#8221; function, but strangely don&#8217;t exist in any of their shared ancestors. Now that I&#8217;ve forced them to conform to my new &#8220;<em>DataViewable<\/em>&#8221; protocol, I can call this essential\u00a0function on either view without knowing whether it is a table or collection.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/wonka-tables-1-500x496.jpg\" alt=\"wonka-tables\" width=\"300\" height=\"496\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-709\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Extending\u00a0Table and Collection Controllers<\/h2>\n<p>When creating an app that has table and collection screens for\u00a0the same data, it is difficult to create extensions\u00a0with shared logic. The reason is because the table and collection API&#8217;s are so close, but are inconsistent nor do they share data-aware ancestors or protocols. Now\u00a0with the new &#8220;<em>DataViewable<\/em>&#8221; protocol in place, I could execute logic against tables and collections interchangeably.<\/p>\n<p>For example, say I&#8217;m feeding the same data to a UITableViewController screen and a UICollectionViewController screen. I can have them conform to a protocol and extend it with data population and reloading. See the new &#8220;<em>DataControllable<\/em>&#8221; protocol below:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb336851340054\/]<br \/>\nInstead of working with &#8220;<em>self.tableView<\/em>&#8221; or &#8220;<em>self.collectionView<\/em>&#8220;, my protocol is going to work with &#8220;<em>self.dataView<\/em>&#8220;, which is a &#8220;<em>DataViewable<\/em>&#8221; control that I created earlier. Even though it can either be a table or collection underneath, I can call &#8220;<em>reloadData<\/em>&#8221; on it, or any other relationship I&#8217;d like to bridge\u00a0between tables and collections.<\/p>\n<p>The table and collection view controllers would look something like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb339073449383\/]<br \/>\nNotice by simply calling &#8220;<em>setupDataSource<\/em>&#8221; on either the\u00a0table and collection view controllers, it gets populated and refreshed with the same logic.<\/p>\n<h2>What the NIB?!<\/h2>\n<p>There is another glaring inconsistency in the table and collection views: &#8220;<em>registerNib<\/em>&#8220;. For table views, the function signature is the first and the collection views is the bottom:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb33c169086155\/]<br \/>\nSpot\u00a0the difference?&#8230; &#8220;<em>forCellReuseIdentifier<\/em>&#8221; versus &#8220;<em>forCellWithReuseIdentifier<\/em>&#8220;. This almost looks like a typo, why the difference?! This makes it difficult for them to conform to the same protocol. So before we attempt to marry them, let&#8217;s reconcile the API\u00a0by extending the table and collection views and add an identical &#8220;<em>registerNib<\/em>&#8221; signature, let&#8217;s also make it less burdensome while we&#8217;re at it:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb33e693310433\/]<br \/>\nThe &#8220;<em>registerNib<\/em>&#8221; signatures are now the same for tables and collections, but I&#8217;ve also made it more convenient by adding optional\u00a0and default\u00a0parameters, like for the cell identifier.\u00a0Also, the function is\u00a0accepting strings instead of forcing the end developer to create <em>nib<\/em> and <em>bundle<\/em> instances first to\u00a0pass them in. I&#8217;ll let the function create instances underneath automatically. This way, I can simply do this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb341461322608\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Sugar and Spice<\/h2>\n<p>For the finale, I&#8217;d like to tackle the dreaded &#8220;<em>dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier<\/em>&#8221; API. The philosophy of Objective-C is to make everything as verbose as possible. On the other hand, the philosophy of Swift is to make everything as swift as possible. So for this archaic API, I&#8217;d like to convert it to a subscript. Makes sense that you&#8217;d retrieve cells out of a table using subscripts, doesn&#8217;t it?! Here it goes:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb343531534407\/]<br \/>\nNow I can simply do this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb346951446181\/]<br \/>\nExtracting the cell from the table using &#8220;<em>tableView[indexPath]<\/em>&#8221; instead of &#8220;<em>tableView.dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier(identifier, forIndexPath: indexPath)<\/em>&#8221; feels so much more natural. I&#8217;ve overloaded it too in case you want to use a different cell identifier.<\/p>\n<h2>Putting It All Together<\/h2>\n<p>We&#8217;ve made some breakthroughs with\u00a0tables and collections in this post. Let&#8217;s\u00a0summarize the evolution.<\/p>\n<p>First is the &#8220;<em>DataViewable<\/em>&#8221; protocol to marry the &#8220;<em>UITableView<\/em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>UICollectionView<\/em>&#8221; together:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb348939123611\/]<br \/>\nNext is the &#8220;<em>DataControllable<\/em>&#8221; protocol to extend the &#8220;<em>UITableViewController<\/em>&#8221; and <em>UICollectionViewController<\/em>&#8221; simultaneously:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeb350848533704\/]<br \/>\nThe &#8220;<em>setupInterface<\/em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>setupDataSource<\/em>&#8221; functions is where you&#8217;d put your view and data retrieval logic.

If you done this before with the iPhone, the steps are similar. However, there are slight differences with Apple Watch and also the latest Xcode 6+ makes this a bit easier with some automation.<\/p>\n<h2>Show Me the Steps!<\/h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Create certificates<\/h3>\n<p>First step is to create a\u00a0production and a development certificate. Although this is annoying, you will only have to do this once ever per machine you develop on. Then it is used for all your apps going forward.<\/p>\n<p>Log into\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/developer.apple.com<\/a>\u00a0and click on the <em>&#8220;Member Center&#8221;<\/em> menu item. From here, click on <em>&#8220;Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles&#8221;<\/em>. Click on <em>&#8220;Certificates&#8221;<\/em> link under the <em>iOS Apps<\/em> section. Phew&#8230; are you still with me? The page should look like this for you:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Apple-Developer-Certificates-section.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-320\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Apple-Developer-Certificates-section.png\" alt=\"Apple Developer Certificates section\" width=\"264\" height=\"475\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Apple-Developer-Certificates-section.png 264w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Apple-Developer-Certificates-section-167x300.png 167w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 264px) 100vw, 264px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Cool, now in the middle of the page, click the <em>&#8220;+&#8221;<\/em> sign to add a new certificate. From here, you will simply follow the wizard and instructions to create your certificate. Do this once for <em>Development &gt; &#8220;iOS App Development&#8221;<\/em> and another certificate for <em>Production &gt; &#8220;App Store and Ad Hoc&#8221;<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Create-Apple-Certificate.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-322\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Create-Apple-Certificate-500x438.png\" alt=\"Create Apple Certificate\" width=\"500\" height=\"438\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Create-Apple-Certificate-500x438.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Create-Apple-Certificate-300x263.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Create-Apple-Certificate.png 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Once you finish the wizard, download the <em>*.cer<\/em> file and double-click it to make sure it opens on your Mac. It should open your Keychain Access app on your Mac and see your new certificates with private keys:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Keychain-Access-App-Store-Certificates.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-323\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Keychain-Access-App-Store-Certificates-500x394.png\" alt=\"Keychain Access - App Store Certificates\" width=\"500\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Keychain-Access-App-Store-Certificates-500x394.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Keychain-Access-App-Store-Certificates-300x236.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Keychain-Access-App-Store-Certificates.png 589w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Remember, these certificates should only be created once per machine, not per app! So now you will never have to do this again when submitting more apps (unless you get a new machine).<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Add your Apple ID to Xcode<\/h3>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t done this already, add your Apple ID to <em>Xcode &gt; Preferences &gt; Accounts<\/em>. This way, Xcode will be able to automatically make changes to your <em>Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles<\/em> when it needs to. Trust me, I&#8217;d rather Xcode make changes it needs than bang my head against the keyboard for hours. It should look something\u00a0like this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode-Apple-ID.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-325\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode-Apple-ID-500x364.png\" alt=\"Xcode Apple ID\" width=\"500\" height=\"364\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode-Apple-ID-500x364.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode-Apple-ID-1024x745.png 1024w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode-Apple-ID-300x218.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode-Apple-ID.png 1478w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Of course, this also only has to be done once per machine, not per app (unless you are submitting apps to multiple different Apple ID&#8217;s).<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Create your project<\/h3>\n<p>Next\u00a0is to create your app in Xcode. If you haven&#8217;t created an Apple Watch app before, be sure to <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/building-an-apple-watch-app\">check my other post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Add capabilities to your project<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes you cannot foresee this, but try to add some basic capabilities you are sure to use. Click on your project from the file list, then in the middle select the target you&#8217;d like to apply this to. Then\u00a0click <em>&#8220;Capabilities&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0across the target menu (where it says <em>General, Capabilities, Info, Build Settings, etc<\/em>) and activate what you need.<\/p>\n<p>Most likely, you will need to add App Groups to store data between the watch and phone. When you activate this, Xcode will ask you which account you would like to enable App Groups for. This is the account you set up in the previous step. Select the account to activate it for when Xcode pops up this window:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_App_Groups_Account.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-318\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_App_Groups_Account-1024x433.png\" alt=\"Xcode App Groups Account\" width=\"500\" height=\"211\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_App_Groups_Account-1024x433.png 1024w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_App_Groups_Account-300x127.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Don&#8217;t forget to enable what you need from the WatchKit Extension target too!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_watch_targets.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-319\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_watch_targets.png\" alt=\"Xcode watch targets\" width=\"414\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_watch_targets.png 414w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Xcode_watch_targets-300x228.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 414px) 100vw, 414px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Now press <em>Command+B<\/em> to make sure the project builds.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Step 5: Creating the Provisioning Profiles<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you got to this point, Xcode created a bunch of stuff automatically for you.

There are thousands of CocoaPods available, but almost all of them are in Objective-C. Today I&#8217;d like to show you how to create CocoaPods in Swift.<\/p>\n<h2>CocoaPod 0.36 and Beyond!&#8230;<\/h2>\n<p>Version 0.36 marks a new milestone in CocoaPods. This was when <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.cocoapods.org\/CocoaPods-0.36\/\" target=\"_blank\">CocoaPods announced official support for Swift<\/a>. Now we will see a new wave of CocoaPods that have been created in Swift. So first thing&#8217;s first, update your CocoaPods to take advantage:\u00a0<em>gem install cocoapods<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Dude, Where&#8217;s My Swift?!<\/h2>\n<p>Although\u00a0CocoaPods officially supports Swift, many\u00a0of the commands and templates associated with creating a new pod is only available in Objective-C (at the time of this writing at least). So we can&#8217;t use <em>&#8220;pod lib create&#8221;<\/em> to let CocoaPods automatically set up your pod structure. No Swift shortcuts yet.<\/p>\n<h2>Show Me the Steps!<\/h2>\n<p>We will have to create out CocoaPod the manual way for Swift. Here are steps to create your Swift pod:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a GitHub repository that will store your CocoaPod.\u00a0There are ways to do this with a private repo if needed, but let&#8217;s stick to open source. Once you create the repo, clone the repo to your local machine.<\/li>\n<li>Now create a Xcode workspace in the folder where\u00a0you\u00a0cloned your repo. You do this in Xcode by going to <em>File &gt; New &gt; Workspace<\/em>. This workspace will be used to house your pod source code, examples, tests, etc.<\/li>\n<li>Create a new <em>PodSpec<\/em> file by navigating to your workspace directory and typing the following command:\u00a0<em>pod spec create YOUR_POD_NAME<\/em>. Open your new spec file and modify it according to your pod. Here is an example of one for a Swift pod:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eebb1c293174297\/]<br \/>\nAll the instructions are in comments when you create the spec file, but hopefully my sample above helps. Notice the last line for <em>&#8220;s.source_files&#8221;<\/em> leads somewhere, but I will get to that in a minute.<\/li>\n<li>Add a new iOS project which will be used to test our CocoaPod. To do this in Xcode, right-click on the left panel in the\u00a0workspace\u00a0and select <em>&#8220;New Project&#8221;<\/em>. Choose a <em>&#8220;Single View Application&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0under <em>iOS &gt; Application<\/em> section, or any project type you like. Be sure to call it <em>&#8220;Example&#8221;<\/em> for consistency with other CocoaPods convention.<\/li>\n<li>Add a new Swift framework by right-clicking in the left-pane again and select <em>&#8220;New Project&#8221;<\/em>. This time, we will select <em>iOS &gt; Framework &amp; Library &gt; Cocoa Touch<\/em>. After clicking next, it is really important to select the right name for your CococaPod, which will be used as a namespace for any project consuming this pod. Also, make sure it is added to the workspace, not the example project:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-CocoaPod.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-461\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-CocoaPod-500x116.png\" alt=\"Swift CocoaPod\" width=\"500\" height=\"116\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-CocoaPod-500x116.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-CocoaPod-300x69.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-CocoaPod.png 778w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<li>Let&#8217;s create a sample Swift file to test things out later. In your new framework folder, add a Swift file called <em>MySwiftPodManager<\/em> or anything you like. Add a function to it to test out.

To do this, drag your Swift framework&#8217;s <em>.xcodeproj<\/em> file and add it the <em>Example<\/em> project root. Your file system in Xcode should look something like this:<a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-CocoaPod.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-462\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-CocoaPod-435x800.png\" alt=\"Swift Framework CocoaPod\" width=\"300\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-CocoaPod-435x800.png 435w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-CocoaPod-300x552.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-CocoaPod.png 448w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/a>We&#8217;re still not done adding the Swift framework as a dependency. Click on the root of your Example project and go to <em>&#8220;Build Phases&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0then add your Swift\u00a0framework to <em>&#8220;Target Dependencies&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0and <em>&#8220;Link Binary With Libraries&#8221;<\/em>. When you click the &#8220;+&#8221; sign, you should see your Swift framework in the list (that&#8217;s why we had to copy the <em>.xcodeproj<\/em> file).\u00a0Still in <em>&#8220;Build Phases&#8221;<\/em>, click on the + button at the top left of the panel and select <em>&#8220;New Copy Files Phase&#8221;<\/em>. Rename this new phase to <em>&#8220;Copy Frameworks&#8221;<\/em>, set the <em>&#8220;Destination&#8221;<\/em> to <em>&#8220;Frameworks&#8221;<\/em>, and add your Swift framework again here. Your entire <em>&#8220;Build Phases&#8221;<\/em> should look something like this:<br \/>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-463\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-Dependency-500x480.png\" alt=\"Swift Framework Dependency\" width=\"500\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-Dependency-500x480.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-Dependency-1024x983.png 1024w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-Dependency-300x288.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Swift-Framework-Dependency.png 1444w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/>To test out this works, go to your <em>Example<\/em> project&#8217;s <em>ViewController<\/em> and add the <em>&#8220;import YOUR_FRAMEWORK_NAME&#8221;<\/em> statement at the top and try using your new manager in the <em>&#8220;viewDidLoad&#8221;<\/em> for example. You may have to build a could times to kick the dependencies into gear, but after that if should not have any errors.<\/li>\n<li>Validate your <em>PodSpec<\/em> file by going into terminal and changing to your workspace, then typing:\u00a0<em>pod spec lint MySwiftPod.podspec<\/em>. At this point, you will probably get this error:\u00a0<em>fatal: Remote branch 0.1 not found in upstream origin<\/em><\/li>\n<li>Commit all your changes to your git repository (I like using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sourcetreeapp.com\" target=\"_blank\">SourceTree<\/a> for this). Once you have committed and pushed your changes, type this into the terminal to create the tag the pod spec validator is complaining about:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eebb2c303000989\/]<br \/>\nNow run the spec validator again and it should now pass validation.<\/li>\n<li>That&#8217;s it! It is now time to test out your new CocoaPod. You can do this before releasing\u00a0it out\u00a0into the wild. Make sure you have everything committed so the latest is in your repo. Close down your project and create a fresh new iOS project for testing. Create a new Pod file by going into Terminal and changing to its directory, then type:\u00a0<em>touch Podfile<\/em>. In this file, add the following:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eebb2f996742545\/]<br \/>\nNotice the <em>&#8220;use_frameworks!&#8221;<\/em> directive at the top. This is telling CocoaPods to enable Swift framework support. Next line is adding a pod to your project, but it is doing so from an arbitrary git repo, not the public CocoaPods directory. This allows you to test your pod without submitting it into the public directory. Save the file and go back to Terminal and type: <em>pod install<\/em>. This will install the CocoaPod to your project and create a workspace to use going forward. Close your project and open the workspace it created for you. Test that you have access to your CocoaPod by\u00a0going to your project&#8217;s\u00a0<em>ViewController<\/em>\u00a0and add the\u00a0<em>&#8220;import YOUR_POD_NAME&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0statement at the top and try using the\u00a0manager you created in your CocoaPod in the\u00a0<em>&#8220;viewDidLoad&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0for example. You may have to build a could times to kick the dependencies into gear, but after that if should not have any errors (sound familiar :).<\/li>\n<li>If everything worked as expected, it&#8217;s time to release your CocoaPod to the world.

Why reinvent the wheel when the community has produced robust and feature-rich plugins? However, one can get easily overwhelmed with the amount of choices out there. So in this post, I&#8217;d like to highlight the best CocoaPods I&#8217;ve used in real-world project that are also Swift-friendly. By that I mean, they are either pure-Swift or at least Objective-C pods\u00a0that have been updated to be compatible with Swift. Here we go&#8230;<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Alamofire\/Alamofire\" target=\"_blank\">Alamofire<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; You won&#8217;t find a <em>&#8220;top CocoaPods list&#8221;<\/em> without this pod on there. It allows you to easily consume web services and do other HTTP network tasks. The API is much sweeter and elegant than Apple&#8217;s rigid and verbose <code>NSURLConnection<\/code> (although Alamofire is just a wrapper to it).<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/SwiftyJSON\/SwiftyJSON\">SwiftyJSON<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; Another heavy-hitter\u00a0in the Swift CocoaPods world. Parse JSON with ease instead of using Apple&#8217;s verbose <code>NSJSONSerialization<\/code> syntax.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/naoty\/Timepiece\" target=\"_blank\">Timepiece<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; Working with dates in Objective-C is such a boring task. The trend continues in Swift unfortunately. This is where Timepiece comes in. Working with dates feels natural, such as comparing dates using arithmetic symbols,\u00a0or\u00a0format with ease instead of using Apple&#8217;s verbose <code>NSDateFormatter<\/code> API. Apple just loves verbose syntax don&#8217;t they!<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ealeksandrov\/EAIntroView\" target=\"_blank\">EAIntroView<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; Ever wanted to create a tutorial for your iOS app? Sure you can create a <code>UIPageControl<\/code> and wire everything up. This pod makes things easier though. Just a few lines of code in your <code>ViewController<\/code> and you&#8217;ve got a beautiful tutorial!<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mineschan\/MZTimerLabel\" target=\"_blank\">MZTimerLabel<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; When working with Apple WatchKit, one thing I really liked that was\u00a0missing in\u00a0iOS was <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/prerelease\/ios\/documentation\/WatchKit\/Reference\/WKInterfaceTimer_class\/\" target=\"_blank\">WKInterfaceTimer<\/a>, or a countdown label. To get a countdown or timer working in iOS, you could get messy with <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Reference\/Foundation\/Classes\/NSTimer_Class\/\" target=\"_blank\">NSTimer<\/a>, yes verbose again! That&#8217;s where this pod comes in. Just instantiate with any label as a constructor parameter and you&#8217;ve instantly got a timer API around it. Beware though, when your app goes in the background, the timer goes stale or acts funny. I don&#8217;t fault this as a bug, but just the way the iOS architecture works to manage resources. I&#8217;ve posted a workaround in a <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/mineschan\/MZTimerLabel\/issues\/5\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub issue<\/a>\u00a0to resolve this and still let iOS manage its resources properly.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Alecrim\/AlecrimCoreData\" target=\"_blank\">AlecrimCoreData<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; You want to talk verbose, try working with the raw <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/CoreData\/cdProgrammingGuide.html\" target=\"_blank\">CoreData<\/a>\u00a0syntax\u00a0from Apple. Yuck!! AlecrimCoreData wraps the CoreData API\u00a0and produces an elegant framework\u00a0on top. Sorting, filtering, querying &#8211; no problem! Since its purely written in Swift, it follows the Swift closure philosophy and makes working with CoreData actually fun and fast! I&#8217;ve looked into\u00a0other wrappers such as <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/magicalpanda\/MagicalRecord\" target=\"_blank\">MagicalRecord<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/QueryKit\/QueryKit\" target=\"_blank\">QueryKit<\/a>, but they\u00a0didn&#8217;t seem so elegant or fluid. Although those other projects helped inspire AlecrimCoreData, what really sets it\u00a0apart are\u00a0its extended <code>FetchedResultsController<\/code> and a class object generator. AlecrimCoreData is the underdog here and I&#8217;m hoping this one takes the crown!<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/AndreyLunevich\/DLImageLoader-iOS\" target=\"_blank\">DLImageLoader<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; There are a ton of async-loading, caching image handlers. Getting one is a must since scrolling your UICollectionView or UITableView will lag like no tomorrow. It&#8217;s really something that should be built right into the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/UIKit\/Reference\/UIImageView_Class\/\" target=\"_blank\">UIImageView<\/a> class. So there are so many to choose from, such as\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/rs\/SDWebImage\" target=\"_blank\">SDWebImage<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Haneke\/HanekeSwift\" target=\"_blank\">Haneke<\/a>, but I chose this one because it seemed light-weight and works great!<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/icanzilb\/SwiftSpinner\" target=\"_blank\">SwiftSpinner<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; Many times, the native <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/UIKit\/Reference\/UIActivityIndicatorView_Class\/\" target=\"_blank\">UIActivityIndicatorView<\/a> seems so mediocre. SwiftSpinner generates a modern-looking\u00a0spinner that keeps the user hypnotized until your app loads its data.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/JaviSoto\/JSBadgeView\" target=\"_blank\">JSBadgeView<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; Adding badges on tab bar buttons is a breeze and comes out-of-the-box, but that&#8217;s where it stops. Adding badges to buttons, navigation items, segmented controls, and other elements doesn&#8217;t come with <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/UIKit\/Reference\/UIKit_Framework\/\" target=\"_blank\">UIKit<\/a>. That&#8217;s where this pod comes in. Add badges to <em>ANY<\/em> control that descends from <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/UIKit\/Reference\/UIView_Class\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">UIView<\/a>, which is\u00a0just about everything, but a workaround is available even for non-UIView controls.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/dzenbot\/DZNEmptyDataSet\" target=\"_blank\">DZNEmptyDataSet<\/a><\/strong> &#8211; Why there isn&#8217;t a property on UITableView or UICollectionView to display an empty message is absurd. This pod does so when you have an empty data set, but it takes it one step further by allowing you to compose an entire view for the empty display.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I hope you\u00a0enjoy!

Congratulations, you&#8217;ve just run unit testing in Swift and Xcode!<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Breaking It Down<\/h2>\n<p>There is some convention to get out the way\u00a0that\u00a0seem simple and straight-forward. Unit test classes inherit from <em>XCTestCase<\/em>. This base class has overridable <em>setUp<\/em> and <em>tearDown<\/em> functions which will run before and after <strong>EACH<\/strong> test (not each instance of <em>XCTestCase<\/em>). <em>setUp<\/em>\u00a0is where you create instances, load data, set up cache, etc; then in <em>tearDown<\/em> you destroy instances if needed, clear data, clear cache, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Functions that are prefixed with the word <em>&#8220;test&#8221;<\/em> is considered a unit test, then gets those nifty diamond icons to run the test. Feel free to create properties or functions in your test class to facilitate your unit testing &#8211; just don&#8217;t prefix them with <em>&#8220;test&#8221;<\/em> unless it is a unit test.<\/p>\n<h2>Show Me the Code!!<\/h2>\n<p>Real code and logic will paint the whole picture so let&#8217;s jump right in. Say we have this super uber utility helper that we\u00a0would like to test:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eec560281898813\/]<br \/>\nThe code is not the point, but it is to illustrate real world logic for context. This particular function <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/updating-query-string-parameters-in-swift\/\" target=\"_blank\">adds and removes query string parameters from a given URL string<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now let&#8217;s unit test this!!!<\/p>\n<h2>The\u00a0Real Unit Test<\/h2>\n<p>In your unit test target, add a new Swift file. For convention, I like to keep the unit test class in the same folder structure as what I&#8217;m testing and append the word <em>&#8220;Tests&#8221;<\/em> at the end of the class name. Also, be sure the target membership is marked for your unit test target.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/CapturFiles_273-500x296.png\" alt=\"Unit Testing - Xcode Code Panes\" width=\"500\" height=\"296\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-638\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/CapturFiles_273-500x296.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/CapturFiles_273-768x455.png 768w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/CapturFiles_273-1024x607.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the unit test\u00a0code\u00a0can look like for my corresponding\u00a0<em>WebHelper<\/em> class:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eec56b846876477\/]<br \/>\nIn each test function, I&#8217;m calling my web helper API, such as <em>addOrUpdateQueryStringParameter<\/em>, with sample data to see if it is indeed adding or removing query string parameters from the URL value. I&#8217;m doing this\u00a0by storing the result in a variable. Then I am comparing them to hard-coded results that I know are true &#8211; using <em>XCTAssert<\/em>. That&#8217;s all there is to it!<\/p>\n<p>It all\u00a0comes down to\u00a0<em>XCTAssert<\/em> and it&#8217;s variations, which takes on a boolean as a parameter value:\u00a0<em>XCTAssert(expression,&#8230;)<\/em>. If the parameter is true, the unit test\u00a0passes; if the parameter\u00a0is false, then it fails.

They range from simple to complex, depending on the type and amount of data saved. On the more complex end of the spectrum, you have SQLite for traditional relational data storage, <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/ios\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Conceptual\/CoreData\/cdProgrammingGuide.html\" target=\"_blank\">Core Data<\/a> for modern object persistance,\u00a0and\u00a0iCloud for device synchronization.

And finally, you have the simplest type of storage, which is\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Reference\/Foundation\/Classes\/NSUserDefaults_Class\/\" target=\"_blank\">NSUserDefaults<\/a>\u00a0that allows you to store simple things like strings and numbers. In this post, I&#8217;d like to focus on NSUserDefaults and how to share it between devices.<\/p>\n<h2>The Scoop\u00a0on NSUserDefaults<\/h2>\n<p>NSUserDefaults\u00a0allows you\u00a0save settings and properties related to application or user data, even if the user exits the app and comes back later. It is usually seen as the quick and dirty way to persist data. The reason I say <em>&#8220;quick and dirty&#8221;<\/em> is because it is dead simple, but sometimes easily abused. The types of data that can stored are the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Strings<\/li>\n<li>Numbers<\/li>\n<li>Booleans<\/li>\n<li>Dates<\/li>\n<li>Arrays<\/li>\n<li>Dictionaries<\/li>\n<li>NSData<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As you can see, it is only simple data that can be stored in NSUserDefaults, with the exception of <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.apple.com\/library\/mac\/documentation\/Cocoa\/Reference\/Foundation\/Classes\/NSData_Class\/\" target=\"_blank\">NSData<\/a>\u00a0which actually serializes data to get around the limitations, but even that has limitations. If you need to persist data any more complex than these, such as collections of custom objects or object relationships, better look at the other storage methods like Core Data.<\/p>\n<h2>Show Me the Code!!<\/h2>\n<p>To actually store data using NSUserDefaults, it is super simple:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eec7ad199575784\/]<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s it!<\/p>\n<p>Ok, but the post title says how to share data between Apple Watch or iPhone. The above code will only save the data to the local device.<\/p>\n<h2>Enter App Groups<\/h2>\n<p>App Groups were introduced in iOS8. It can be thought of as a container of data in the cloud that multiple apps and widgets can share. They are synchronized to the device so they become available offline, but sync up when online. Bless the souls who had to share data prior to iOS8.<\/p>\n<p>To start using App Groups, you must enable it for each target in your Xcode project that will need to use it:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/iOS-App-Groups.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-477\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/iOS-App-Groups-500x242.png\" alt=\"iOS App Groups\" width=\"500\" height=\"242\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/iOS-App-Groups-500x242.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/iOS-App-Groups-1024x496.png 1024w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/iOS-App-Groups-300x145.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/iOS-App-Groups.png 1246w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>When you hit the <em>&#8220;+&#8221;<\/em> button, you will create your\u00a0container ID that all targets and apps will use.\u00a0An app group container ID begins with <em>&#8220;group.&#8221;<\/em>\u00a0followed by a string in reverse DNS notation. An example is: <em>group.com.example.My-App<\/em>. Xcode will actually make the change to your App ID in your developer account automatically.<\/p>\n<p>To use App Groups, it&#8217;s not that different or difficult to use than NSUserDefaults:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eec7b4918694498\/]<br \/>\nThe only differences here are\u00a0how NSUserDefaults is instantiated and calling <em>synchronize<\/em> at the end. You feed it the container ID to the constructor parameter called <em>&#8220;suiteName&#8221;<\/em>, then call <em>&#8220;synchronize()&#8221;<\/em>, and your data flies to the cloud for other apps and devices to consume.<\/p>\n<p>Although I titled this post how to share data between Apple Watch and iPhone, this can be used with any device in the Apple ecosystem, including OS X and iPads.<\/p>\n<h2>Taking It to the Next Level<\/h2>\n<p>You can take this one step further by creating a class for your app and abstract the underlying storage for your properties. Here&#8217;s an example:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eec7b7144487927\/]<br \/>\nAt the top of the class, I am declaring my group container ID and creating the NSUserDefault object out of it. Then my properties for the class have getters and setters to store the data to the App Group. If the key doesn&#8217;t exist, it creates it with a default value and synchronizes it. Using the class from this point forward is simple:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eec7bc586568311\/]<br \/>\nThis property is stored in the cloud! Everything is abstracted away for you. You don&#8217;t have to be bothered about\u00a0storing and synchronizing it into the App Group. It&#8217;s all done automatically for you in the getters and setters!<\/p>\n<p>The true power of this becomes realized when you put this class in <a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/creating-a-framework-in-swift\/\">a Swift framework<\/a> and start sharing it between targets and even projects.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>HAPPY CODING!!<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n"},{"id":386,"title":"Adding WatchKit Table Lists in Apple Watch","slug":"adding-watchkit-table-lists-in-apple-watch","type":"post","excerpt":"Displaying a list of records to users is one of the most common needs for any application.

The table row that is displayed is a template that will be used for all the rows\u00a0and acts\u00a0like a group container. In it, you will drag and drop other controls into it. For this example, let us simply add an image and a label:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Controls.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-388 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Controls-500x442.png\" alt=\"WatchKit Table Controls\" width=\"500\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Controls-500x442.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Controls-1024x905.png 1024w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Controls-300x265.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Controls.png 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Notice that the controls are placed side-to-side in the table. Again, it acts like the group control. Let&#8217;s size it right so the image takes up 25% and the label takes up 75% of the width. See the size section in the above screenshot: 0.25 of the relative to container size.<\/p>\n<h2>Dude, Where&#8217;s My Rows?!<\/h2>\n<p>How do you populate the rows with your records though? This takes a few steps. First, let&#8217;s create an outlet for our table onto our interface class. We do this by <em>Control+dragging<\/em> the table onto the class in split view.

In the storyboard, show the document outline so you can see the control hierarchy of your interface, then highlight the <em>&#8220;Table Row Controller&#8221;<\/em>:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Doc-Outline.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-389\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Doc-Outline-500x421.png\" alt=\"WatchKit Table Doc Outline\" width=\"500\" height=\"421\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Doc-Outline-500x421.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Doc-Outline-1024x863.png 1024w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Doc-Outline-300x253.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Table-Doc-Outline.png 1068w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Then in the right pane, we are going to adjust the properties for the table row.

We do this by letting the app know how many rows this table will have, then loop through it and update the row programmatically:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eeca28314350306\/]<br \/>\nNotice I am using the same identifier name set in the properties when calling <em>&#8220;currentTable.setNumberOfRows&#8221;<\/em>. Also, I am casting the row to our class &#8220;CategoryRowView&#8221; in each iteration of the loop. This way, I can update the row outlets.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing worth mentioning is I populated the table\u00a0in the <em>&#8220;willActivate&#8221;<\/em> event, but this will also work in the <em>&#8220;awakeWithContext&#8221;<\/em> event. It depends on how dynamic your table will be. If the table data is constantly changing, load the table in the <em>&#8220;willActivate&#8221;<\/em> event so every time the user loads that page, it will query fresh data. Otherwise, the data will be stale and only load when the app loads the first time. It depends on the scenario really and balancing that with performance.<\/p>\n<h2>The Demo<\/h2>\n<p>Your WatchKit app should look something like this:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Watchkit-Table-Demo-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-395\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Watchkit-Table-Demo-2-500x650.png\" alt=\"Watchkit Table Demo 2\" width=\"500\" height=\"650\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Watchkit-Table-Demo-2-500x650.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Watchkit-Table-Demo-2-300x390.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Watchkit-Table-Demo-2.png 622w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>It populated each row using the row controller of the table.

We are here to talk about taking array of types once step further!<\/p>\n<h2>What the Hack?<\/h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the array of types fall short in allowing you to store an array of complex types.

What ties it with other categories is the integer suffix.

To do this, click on the interface controller in the storyboard, then on the left pane, go to the <em>&#8220;Identity inspector&#8221;<\/em>. From there, type or find your class in the list to assign it:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Identity-Inspector.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-406 size-medium\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Identity-Inspector-500x588.png\" alt=\"WatchKit Number Keypad Identity Inspector\" width=\"500\" height=\"588\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Identity-Inspector-500x588.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Identity-Inspector-300x353.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Identity-Inspector.png 514w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re here, give the interface an identifier so it can be called with the\u00a0<em>presentControllerWithName<\/em> function later, and also give it a title of <em>&#8220;Done&#8221;<\/em>, which will will stick on the top left corner of the number keypad to close the keypad.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Number-Keypad-Controller-Properties-2.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-417 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Number-Keypad-Controller-Properties-2.png\" alt=\"Number Keypad Controller Properties 2\" width=\"254\" height=\"138\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>Now that the interface is glued to the Swift class, you can now create outlets and actions for\u00a0the labels and buttons. To do this, hold down\u00a0the <em>Control<\/em> key and drag each of the components onto your Swift class:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-407\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Action-500x346.png\" alt=\"WatchKit Number Keypad Action\" width=\"500\" height=\"346\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Action-500x346.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Action-300x207.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/WatchKit-Number-Keypad-Action.png 742w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Remember, you will need these to be actions so you can respond to the tap.

There are some special cases we need to handle, such as decimals and zeros, but let&#8217;s wrap it up in a function so it can be shared across the number buttons like this:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eece96467952021\/]<br \/>\nThe <em>appendValue<\/em> function handles the appending of numbers as the user taps on the buttons. If the value is zero, it will overwrite it, signifying it&#8217;s a fresh start. The <em>isDecimalAppend<\/em> is an indicator if the user type a decimal place previously so it can append it before the new number. The <em>isPointZeroAppended<\/em> is a tricky scenario if the user\u00a0types a zero after a decimal place. It will keep rounding off the zero because of <em>getDisplayAmount<\/em>, so this flag adds the zero back in before adding the new number. We haven&#8217;t talked about what the\u00a0<em>sourceController<\/em> variable is yet, but we will cover that in just a bit. First, let&#8217;s handle the <em>clear<\/em>, <em>decimal<\/em>, and <em>positive\/negative<\/em> buttons:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eece9e924758244\/]<\/p>\n<h2>Using the Number Keypad<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we have our number keypad working, it&#8217;s time for another controller to make use of it.\u00a0In your main controller, add a variable called <em>&#8220;amount&#8221;<\/em>, which is\u00a0the value the\u00a0number keypad will update. This is what the <em>sourceController<\/em> variable was referring to in the number keypad controller. Then add a button and create an action for it, which will popup the number keypad. It makes sense to make the keypad open as a modal so it doesn&#8217;t inject itself into the page history for the back button. Here&#8217;s what the code looks like:<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eecea1136452101\/]<br \/>\nNotice in the <em>presentControllerWithName<\/em>, it is passing the whole main controller object into the context. That way, the number keypad controller will be able to update the previous screen (to get to the <em>amount<\/em> variable).<\/p>\n<h2>Putting It All Together<\/h2>\n<p>The main interface controller is relatively simple. It&#8217;s just a label and a button. The button will open up the number keypad to update the label. Here is what the interface looks like:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Source-Controller-Number-Keypad.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-409\" src=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Source-Controller-Number-Keypad-500x462.png\" alt=\"Source Controller Number Keypad\" width=\"500\" height=\"462\" srcset=\"http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Source-Controller-Number-Keypad-500x462.png 500w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Source-Controller-Number-Keypad-300x277.png 300w, http:\/\/basememara.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Source-Controller-Number-Keypad.png 546w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>The interface class will have an <em>amount<\/em> variable that will keep track of the current value of the interface. This will be updated later by the number keypad&#8217;s controller. The <em>loadData<\/em> function is placed in the <em>willActivate<\/em> event so that the <em>amountLabel<\/em> is updated with the latest amount when this screen is shown again. The <em>getDisplayAmount<\/em> will do just display the amount in a friendly way. And finally, the <em>buttonTapped<\/em> will call the number keypad screen and pass the whole controller\u00a0as the context so it can be updated in the remote number keypad controller. Here&#8217;s the full interface code!<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eecea4750730555\/]<br \/>\nFor the number keypad controller, the trick is to store the previous controller context in a variable in the <em>awakeWithContext<\/em> event. That way, the number keypad controller always has a reference to the previous screen to update the <em>amount<\/em> variable. Here&#8217;s the full number keypad controller code!<br \/>\n[crayon-5b1d297eecea7255776782\/]<br \/>\nBelow is what the screens should look and behave like in the emulator.

In the project, there are three areas you will be working with:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The iPhone app labeled here as <em>&#8220;My First Watch App&#8221;<\/em>. At the time of this writing, there is no way around this; you need an iPhone app for every Apple Watch app! If you are racking your brain what the iPhone app will do,\u00a0make it a simple configuration page for your watch app.<\/li>\n<li>The WatchKit extension labeled here as <em>&#8220;My First Watch App WatchKit Extension App&#8221;<\/em>. This where most of the code for your watch app will be, such as interface controller classes. What&#8217;s interesting to note is that this area will actually be executed on the iPhone via bluetooth or wifi, not on the Apple Watch. This is to remove burden and power consumption from the watch.<\/li>\n<li>The WatchKit app labeled here as <em>&#8220;My First Watch App&#8221;<\/em>. This is everything that will be stored on the Apple Watch itself, such as storyboards, images, etc.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Show Me the App!<\/h2>\n<p>Are you ready to see the app?
